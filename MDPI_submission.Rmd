abstract: |
  The shortwave downward solar irradiance (SDR) is an important factor that drives climate processes, production and can affect all living organisms.
  Observations of SDR at different locations around the world with different environmental characteristics have been used to investigate its long-term variability and trends at different time scales.
  Periods of positive trends are referred as brightening periods and of negative trends as dimming periods.
  Here we studied 30 years of pyranometer data in Thessaloniki, Greece, under three types of sky conditions (clear sky, cloudy sky and all sky).
  The clear-sky data were identified by applying a cloud screening algorithm. We found a positive trend of $0.38\,\%/\text{year}$ for all-sky, $0.35\,\%/\text{year}$ for clear-sky conditions, and $-0.28\,\%/\text{year}$ for cloudy conditions.
  We have also investigated the consistency of these trends, their seasonal variability, and the effect of the solar zenith angle. 
  We have found that for all-sky and clear-sky conditions the SDR trend is positive in winter ($0.7$ and $0.8\,\%/\text{year}$, respectively) and autumn ($~0.4\,\%/\text{year}$), while under cloudy skies the trend is negative ($-0.9\,\%/\text{year}$ in winter and $-0.4\,\%/\text{year}$ in autumn). 
  In spring and summer the trend is very close to zero, irrespective of sky conditions. 
  The SDR trend is increasing with increasing solar zenith angle, except under cloudy skies where the trend is highly variable and close to zero.
  Finally, we identified some anomalies in the long term SDR trends for all sky conditions by examining the cumulative sums of monthly anomalies from the climatological mean.

The shortwave downward solar irradiance (SDR) at Earth's surface plays a significant role, on its climate.
Changes of the SDR can be related to changes on Earth's energy budget, the mechanisms of climate change, and water and carbon cycles [@Wild2009].
It can also affect solar and agricultural production, and all living organisms.
Studies of SDR variability, have identified some distinct SDR trends on different regions of the world on different time periods.
The term 'brightening' is generally used to describe periods of positive SDR trend, and 'dimming' for negative trend [@Wild2009].
There are many cases in the long term records of irradiance, showing a systematic change in the magnitude of the trend, occurring roughly in the last decades of the 20th century.
<!-- Trends china -->
On multiple stations in China, a dimming period was reported until about 2000, followed by a brightening period [@Yang2021].
<!-- Trends Europe Brazil -->
A similar pattern was identified, with the breaking point around 1980, for stations in Central Europe [@Wild2021] and Brazil [@Yamasoe2021].
<!-- Trends Global -->
On global scale, an artificial Intelligence aided spatial analysis on continental level with data from multiple stations reach similar conclusions for these regions and for the global trend [@Yuan2021].

There is a consensus among researchers that the major factor affecting the variability of SDR attenuation is the interactions of solar radiation with atmospheric aerosols and clouds.
Those interactions, among other factors, have been analysed with models [@Li2016; @Samset2018], showing the existence of feedback mechanisms between the two.
Similar findings have been shown in observational data [@Schwarz2020; @Ohvril2009; @Zerefos2009; @Xia2007 and references therein].
<!-- Sun variability: should cite that there is no significant trend found Wild2021 -->

Due to the significant spatial and temporal variability of the trends, and the contributing factors, there is a constant need to monitor and investigate SDR in different sites in order to estimate the degree of variability,  and its relation to the local conditions.
In this study, we examine the trends of SDR, using ground-based measurements at Thessaloniki, Greece, for the period `r year(min(ALL_1_daily_DESEAS$Date))` to `r year(max(ALL_1_daily_DESEAS$Date))`, as derived from a CM-21 pyranometer.
<!-- goals -->
We reevaluated and extended the dataset used by @Bais2013, we applied a different algorithm for the identification of clear-/cloud-sky instances [@Reno2016; @Reno2012a], and we derived the SDR trends for the period of study, under different sky conditions (all-sky, clear-sky and cloud-sky).
Finally, we investigated the dependence of the trends on solar zenith angle and season.

Aerosols not only strengthen but also weaken the
growth of clouds with respect to their coverage and
optical thickness, depending on the levels of pollution
and the associated amounts of aerosols as postulated
in a conceptual framework (Wild 2009a, 2012, Yang
et al 2012).

# Observational data and methodology.

The SDR data were measured with a Kipp & Zonen CM-21 pyranometer operating continuously at the Laboratory of Atmospheric Physics of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki
($40^\circ\,38'\,$N, $22^\circ\,57'\,$E, $80\,$m\ a.s.l.)
in the period from
<!-- \mbox{ -->
`r min(ALL_1_daily_DESEAS$Date)`
<!-- } -->
to
<!-- \mbox{ -->
`r max(ALL_1_daily_DESEAS$Date)`.
<!-- }. -->
The monitoring site is located near the city centre, and we expect to be affected by the urban environment.
During the study period, the pyranometer has been independently calibrated three times at the Meteorologisches Observatorium Lindenberg, DWD, when it was verified the stability of the instrument to within better than $0.7\%$ relative to the initial calibration by the manufacturer.
Along with SDR, the direct beam radiation (DNI) was also measured by a collocated Kipp & Zonen CHP-1 pyrheliometer, for the period
<!-- \mbox{ -->
`r min(ALL_1_daily_DESEAS[!is.na(DIR_att), Date])`
<!-- } -->
to
<!-- \mbox{ -->
`r max(ALL_1_daily_DESEAS[!is.na(DIR_att), Date])`.
<!-- }. -->
Although, we have performed a similar analysis to the DNI data, the results are not presented here, as they lack the appropriate statistical significance, due to the sorter duration of the data.
However, the DNI data were used as auxiliary data, in the clear sky identification algorithm (CSid), which is discussed later, for the selection of the appropriate thresholds.
It is noted that despite the capability of the CSid algorithm to use the DNI as a characterization parameter, we haven't utilized it here, to avoid any selection bias, due to unequal length of the two datasets.
There are four distinct steps in the creation of the dataset analysed here:
a)\ the acquisition of radiation measurements from the sensors,
b)\ the data quality check,
c)\ the identification of "clear sky" conditions from the radiometric data, and
d)\ the aggregation of data and trend analysis.

pollutants from Europe, in the path of the prevailing long-range

<!-- a) acquisition -->
For the acquisition of radiometric data, the signal of the pyranometer is sampled with a rate of $1\,\text{Hz}$.
The mean and the standard deviation of these samples are recorded every minute.
The measurements are corrected for the zero offset ("dark signal" in volts).
The "dark signal" is calculated by averaging all measurements recorded for a period of
$3\,\text{h}$,
before (morning) or after (evening) the Sun reaches an elevation angle of
$-10^\circ$.
The signal is converted to irradiance using a ramped value of the instrument’s sensitivity between calibrations.

<!-- b) Radiation data quality check -->
A manual screening was performed, to remove inconsistent and erroneous recordings that can occur stochastically or systematically, during the continuous operation of the instruments.
The manual screening is aided by a radiation data quality assurance procedure, adjusted for the site, which is based on the methods of
Long and Shi\ [-@Long2008a; -@Long2006].
Thus, problematic recordings have been excluded from further processing.
Although it is impossible to detect all false data, the large number of available data, and the aggregation scheme we used, ensures the good quality of the radiation measurements used in this study.

<!-- c) Clear sky identification -->
In order to be able to estimate the effect of the sky conditions on the long term variability of SDR, we created three datasets, by characterizing each one-minute measurement with a corresponding sky condition (i.e., all-sky, clear-sky and cloudy-sky).
To identify the clear-sky conditions we used a method proposed by
@Long2000
and by
@Reno2016,
which were adapted and configured for the site, as the authors suggest.

<!-- CS subjectivity -->
We have to note, that the definition of clear or cloudy sky, has some subjectivity, in any method of characterization.
As a result, the details of the definition are site specific, it relies on a combination of thresholds and comparisons with ideal radiation models and statistical analysis of different signal metrics.
The CSid algorithm was calibrated with the main focus, to identify the presence of clouds on the sky.
Despite the fine-tuning of the procedure, a few marginal cases exist, that have been identified manually as false positive or false negative but cannot affect the final results of the study.

<!-- # Detection of clear periods in GHI measurements for SDR trends. -->

For completeness, we will provide below a brief overview of the clear sky identification algorithm (CSid), along with the site specific thresholds.
To calculate the reference clear sky $\text{SDR}_\text{CSref}$ we used the $\text{SDR}_\text{Haurwitz}$ derived by the radiation model of @Haurwitz1945, adjusted for our site with a factor $a$ (Eq.\ \ref{eq:ahau}), resulted by an iterative optimization process, as described by @Long2000 and @Reno2016.
The target of the optimization was the minimization of a function $f(a)$ (Eq.\ \ref{eq:minf}) and was accomplished with the algorithmic function "optimise", which is an implementation based on the work of @Brent1973, from the library "stats" of the R programming language [@RCT2023].
<!-- cost function -->
\begin{equation}
f(a) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} ( \text{SDR}_{\text{CSid},i} - a \times \text{SDR}_{\text{testCSref},i} )^2 \label{eq:minf}
\end{equation}
where: $n$ is the total number of daylight records, $\text{SDR}_{\text{CSid},i}$ are the records identified as clear sky by CSid, $a$ is a hypothetical adjustment factor, and $\text{SDR}_{\text{testCSref},i}$ is any of the tested clear sky radiation models.

The optimization and the selection of the clear sky reference model, was performed on SDR observations for the period 2016 - 2021.
During the optimization, eight simple clear sky radiation models were tested (namely, Daneshyar-Paltridge-Proctor, Kasten-Czeplak, Haurwitz, Berger-Duffie, Adnot-Bourges-Campana-Gicquel, Robledo-Soler, Kasten and Ineichen-Perez), with a wide range of factors.
These models are described in more details by @Reno2012 and evaluated by @Reno2016.
We found, that Haurwitz's model, adjusted with the factor $a = `r signif(alpha,3)`$ yields one of the lowest root mean squared errors (RMSE), while the procedure, manages to characterize the majority of the data.
Thus, our clear sky reference is derived by the Eq.\ \ref{eq:ahau}.
<!-- adjusted Haurwitz -->
\begin{equation}
\text{SDR}_\text{CSref} = a \times \text{SDR}_\text{Haurwitz} = `r signif(alpha,3)` \times 1098 \times \cos(\theta) \times \exp \left( \frac{ - 0.057}{\cos(\theta)} \right) \label{eq:ahau}
\end{equation}
where: $\text{SDR}_\text{CSref}$ is the reference clear sky SDR, in $\text{W}\,\text{m}^{-2}$ and $\theta$ is the solar zenith angle (SZA).

The criteria that were used to identify whether a measurement was taken under clear-sky conditions are presented below.
A data point is flagged as "clear-sky" if all criteria are satisfied, otherwise it is considered to be "cloud-sky".
Each criterion was applied for a running window of $`r nt`$ consecutive one-minute measurements, and the characterization is assigned to the central value of the window.
Each parameter, was calculated both from the observations and the reference clear sky model, for each comparison.
The allowable range of variation is defined by the model-derived value of the parameter multiplied by a factor plus an offset.
The factors and the offsets were determined empirically, by manually inspecting each filter's performance on selected days and adjusting them accordingly during an iterative process.
The criteria are:
<!-- 1. MeanVIP -->
<!-- ### Mean value of irradiance during the time period. -->
<!--a) Mean of the measured $\overline{\text{SDR}}_i$ = \text{mean}_{n=i-5}^{n=i+5}[\text{SDR}_{n}]$ and running mean of the reference $\overline{\text{SDR}}_{\text{CSref},i}$ = \text{mean}_{n=i-5}^{n=i+5}[\text{SDR}_{\text{CSref},n}]$ (Eq. \ref{eq:MeanVIP}).-->

a) Mean of the measured $\overline{\text{SDR}}_i$ (Eq. \ref{eq:MeanVIP}).
\begin{equation}

< \overline{\text{SDR}}_i <
`r 1 + CS_ref_rm_VIP_RelUpp` \times \overline{\text{SDR}}_{\text{CSref},i} + `r CS_ref_rm_VIP_UppOff`\,Wm^{-2}
\label{eq:MeanVIP}
\end{equation}
<!-- 2. MaxVIP -->
<!-- ### Max value of irradiance during the time period. -->
<!-- The running max measured value $M_{\text{SDR},i} = \max_{n=i-5}^{n=i+5}[\text{SDR}_{n}]$, is compared to a similar constructed value from the reference $M_{CSrefi} = \max_{n=i-5}^{n=i+5}[\text{SDR}_{\text{CSref},n}]$ (Eq.\ \ref{eq:MaxVIP}). -->
b) Maximum measured value $M_{i}$ (Eq.\ \ref{eq:MaxVIP}).
\begin{equation}
`r MaxVIP_fct` \times M_{\text{CSref},i} - `r MaxVIP_off_low`\,Wm^{-2}
< M_{i} <
`r MaxVIP_fct` \times M_{\text{CSref},i} + `r MaxVIP_off_upp`\,Wm^{-2}

<!-- ### Variability in irradiance by line length. -->
c) Length $L_i$ of the sequential line segments, connecting the points of the $`r nt`$ SDR values (Eq. \ref{eq:VILeq}).
\begin{equation}
L_i = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\sqrt{\left ( \text{SDR}_{i+1} - \text{SDR}_{i}\right )^2 + \left ( t_{i+1} - t_i \right )^2}
\label{eq:VILeq}

\begin{equation}

where: $t_i$ is the time stamp of each SDR measurement.

\begin{equation}
  X_i < `r offVSM`\,Wm^{-2} \label{eq:VSMcr}
\end{equation}

<!-- ### Data selection -->
Due to the significant measurement uncertainty when the Sun is near the horizon, we have excluded all measurements with SZA greater than $`r 90-MIN_ELEVA`^\circ$.
Moreover, due to some obstructions around the site (hills and buildings), we excluded data with azimuth angle between
$35^\circ$ and $120^\circ$ with SZA greater than $80^\circ$.
On the latter instances, Sun is systematically not visible from the instrument's location.
<!-- 1au -->
To make the measurements comparable throughout the dataset, we adjusted all one-minute radiometric values to the mean Sun - Earth distance.
<!-- TSI -->
Subsequently, we made all measurements relative to the Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) at $1\,\text{au}$, in order to compensate for the Sun's intensity variability, using a time series of satellite TSI observations.
The TSI data we used are part of the "NOAA Climate Data Record of Total Solar Irradiance" dataset [@Coddington2005].
The initial daily values of this dataset were interpolated to match the time step of our measurements.
In the final dataset
<!-- $`r SDR_N_All`$ -->
$`r signif(100 * SDR_N_Clear / SDR_N_All, 3)`\%$
of the data were identified as under clear-sky conditions and
$`r signif(100 * SDR_N_Cloud / SDR_N_All, 3)`\%$
as under cloud-sky conditions.
<!-- The TSI data we use, is a combination of data from NOAA [@Coddington2005] (for `r as.Date(TSIinfo[TSI_Source == "NOAA", Start])` - `r as.Date(TSIinfo[TSI_Source == "NOAA", End])`) and adjusted data from @LASP2023 (for `r as.Date(TSIinfo[TSI_Source != "NOAA", Start])` - `r as.Date(TSIinfo[TSI_Source != "NOAA", End])`).-->

<!-- aggregation -->
In order to investigate the SDR trends, we implemented an appropriate aggregation scheme to the 1-minute data to derive a series in coarser time-scales.
To preserve the representativeness of the data we used the following criteria:
<!-- a) for daily mean values we exclude days with less than `r Daily_aggregation_N_lim` valid data points, -->
a) for the daily mean values we accept days with more than `r 100 * All_daily_ratio_lim`% of the daytime measurements present and valid,
b) monthly values were computed from daily means
only when at least `r Monthly_aggegation_N_lim` days were available.
To create the daily and monthly climatological means, we averaged the data based on the day of year and calendar month, respectively.
<!-- Seasonal -->
For the seasonal means we averaged the mean daily values in each season (Winter: December - February, Spring: March - May, etc.).
<!-- Deseasonalization -->
Finally, each data set was deseasonalized by subtracting the corresponding climatological annual cycle (daily or monthly) from the actual data.
To estimate the SZA effect on the SDR trends, the one-minute data were aggregated in $1^\circ$ SZA bins, separately for the morning and afternoon hours, and then were deseasonalized as mentioned above.

We calculated the linear SDR trends, from the departures of the mean daily values from the daily climatology and for the three sky conditions (Table\ \ref{tab:trendtable}).
In Figure\ \ref{fig:trendALL} we present only the time series under all-sky conditions; the plots for clear-sky and cloud-sky conditions, are very similar and are shown in the Appendix (Figures\ \ref{fig:trendCLEAR} and\  \ref{fig:trendCLOUD}).
We observe a positive trend for all-sky conditions
($`r alltrend`\,\%/y$), a very close but smaller trend for clear-skies ($`r cleartrend`\,\%/y$) and a negative weaker trend for cloudy-skies ($`r cloudtrend`\,\%/y$).
In the studied period, there is no significant break or change in the variability of the time series.
Other studies for the European region reported a change of the SDR slope, around 1980 [@Wild2021; @Yuan2021; @Ohmura2009], a few years before the start of our records.
It is interesting to note, that for the observations period, the trend of the TSI is
$`r format(TSIslopeAll[1,1], scientific = F, digits = 2)`\,\%/y$,
and thus we can not attribute any major effect on SDR trend to Solar variability.

```

Although the year-to-year variability of the anomalies (Figure \ref{fig:trendALL} and Figures \ref{fig:trendCLEAR}, \ref{fig:trendCLOUD} in Appendix), shows a rather homogeneous behaviour, plots of the cumulative sums (CUSUM) [@Regier2019] of the anomalies can reveal different structures in the records of all three sky conditions.
In the cases of all-sky and clear-sky conditions (Figures \ref{fig:cusummonth-1} and \ref{fig:cusummonth-2}), we observe three macroscopic periods.
A downward part from the start until about 2005, a relatively steady part until about 2016 and, finally, a steep upward part until the present.
For cloud-sky (Figure\ \ref{fig:cusummonth-3}), we have a different pattern; it begins with a relatively steady part until 1997, followed by an upward part until 2005, and a long decline until 2020, with a small positive slope until the present.
For a uniform trend, we would expect the CUSUMs of the anomalies to have a symmetric 'V' shape.
This would indicate that the anomalies are evenly distributed around the climatological mean, and for a positive uniform trend, the first half to be below and the other half above the climatological mean.
In our case, there is a more complex evolution of the anomalies.
Another distinct feature of the CUSUMs, is the different pattern of the cloudy-sky dataset which peaks around the middle of the period.
Although, there seems to exist a complementary relation to the CUSUMs of the clear- and all-sky cases, we can not assert that clouds are the main driver for this relation due to the great difference in the number of observational data between the two datasets (Table\ \ref{tab:trendtable}).

<!-- ``` -->

In order to investigate further the features of the CUSUMs, we created another set of CUSUM plots by subtracting the corresponding long term trend from the SDR anomaly data, prior to the CUSUM calculation (Figure\ \ref{fig:cusumnotrendmonthly}).
With this approach periods when the CUSUMs diverge from zero can be interpreted as a systematic variation of SDR from the climatological mean. 
When the CUSUM is increasing, the added values are above the climatological values of the SDR trend and vice versa.
Overall, for all- and clear-sky conditions (Figures\ \ref{fig:cusumnotrendmonthly-1} and\ \ref{fig:cusumnotrendmonthly-2}) we observe periods when the anomalies diverge from the climatological value, each lasting for several years.
The pattern in both datasets is very similar, suggesting prevalence in clear skies over Thessaloniki.
It is interesting that in the period 1993 - 2016 the anomalies have a high variability around zero, while after 2016, the range of the variability is decreased to about one third of the prior period.
For cloudy-sky conditions (Figure\ \ref{fig:cusumnotrendmonthly-3}) the period 1997 - 2008 is dominated by positive CUSUMs, suggesting a reduced effect of clouds on SDR.
From 1997 to mid-2000s CUSUMs are increasing, likely due to a continuous decrease in the optical thickness of clouds, followed by a period of rapid increase (within 3 years) in cloud optical thickness lasting up to 2008.
The following stable period spans for about 15 years up to 2021 when CUSUMs start increasing again.

## Effects of the solar zenith angle on SDR.

The solar zenith angle is a major factor of SDR reaching the ground, due to the enhancement of the radiation path in the atmosphere, especially in urban environments with human activities emitting aerosols [@Wang2021].
In order to estimate the effect of the SZA on the SDR trends, we grouped the anomaly data in bins of $1^\circ$ SZA, and calculated the overall trend for each bin before noon and after noon (Figure\ \ref{fig:szatrends}).
Although there are seasonal dependencies of the minimum SZA (see Appendix, Figure\ \ref{fig:SZAtrendSeason}), these dependencies would not be further examined here.
For all-sky and clear-sky conditions the brightening effect of SDR (positive trend) is stronger for large SZAs (Figures\ \ref{fig:szatrends-1} and \ref{fig:szatrends-2}).
The trends in the morning and afternoon hours are more or less consistent with small differences, which can be attributed to systematic diurnal variations of aerosols, particularly during the warm period of the year [@Wang2021].
For cloudy-sky conditions (Figure\ \ref{fig:szatrends-3}), we can not discern any significant dependence of the SDR trend with SZA.
For SZAs $16^\circ$ - $50^\circ$, the trends range within about $\pm 0.2\,\%/y$, with a weak statistical significance.
Between $50^\circ$ and $75^\circ$ SZA the trends for the period before noon are stronger and negative, possibly associated with stronger attenuation by clouds under oblique incidence angles.

Similarly to the long term trends discussed above, we have calculated the trend of the anomalies for the three different sky conditions, and for each season of the year, using the corresponding mean monthly values
(Figure\ \ref{fig:seasonalALL} and Table\ \ref{tab:trendseasontable}).
For all-sky conditions the trend in SDR in winter is the largest
($`r signif(spp$"Trend [%/year]"[spp$Season == "Winter" & spp$"Sky condition" == "All sky"], 2)`\,\%/y$),
followed by the trend in autumn
($`r signif(spp$"Trend [%/year]"[spp$Season == "Autumn" & spp$"Sky condition" == "All sky"], 2)`\,\%/y$,
a value close to the long term trend) both statistically significant above the $99\,\%$ confidence level.
In spring and summer, the trends are much smaller and of lesser statistical significance.
These seasonal differences indicate a possible relation of the trends in SDR to trends of clouds during winter and autumn.
For clear-skies, the trend in winter is $`r signif(spp$"Trend [%/year]"[spp$Season == "Winter" & spp$"Sky condition" == "Clear sky"], 2)`\,\%/y$, larger than for all-skies ($`r signif(spp$"Trend [%/year]"[spp$Season == "Winter" & spp$"Sky condition" == "All sky"], 2)`\,\%/y$), which is another indication of a decreasing trend in cloud optical thickness.
Moreover, the trends under clear- and cloudy-sky conditions are almost complementary to each other, particularly for winter and autumn, where the signal is stronger.
During spring and summer the statistical significance is very low and the actual trend too small for a meaningful comparison.

# Conclusions

We have demonstrated that in the period
`r paste(year(min(ALL_1_daily_DESEAS$Date)), " - ", year(max(ALL_1_daily_DESEAS$Date)))`, there is a positive trend in SDR of ($`r alltrend`\,\%/y$) (brightening) (positive trend) in Thessaloniki, Greece, under all-sky conditions.
A previous study [@Bais2013] for the period 1993 - 2011 found also a positive trend of $0.33\,\%/y$.
The increase of this trend indicates that the brightening of SDR continues and is probably caused by continuing decreases in aerosol optical depth and the optical thickness of clouds over the area.
Moreover, we found a similar trend under clear-sky conditions ($`r cleartrend`\,\%/y$) that further supports the assumption that the brightening is caused mainly by decreasing aerosols.
Unfortunately, for the entire period there is no available data for the aerosols, in order to quantify their effect on SDR. 
However, @Siomos2020 have shown that aerosol optical depth over Thessaloniki is decreasing constantly at least up to 2018.
The attenuation of SDR by aerosols over Europe have been proposed as major factor by @Wild2021.
The dimming effect on SDR under cloudy-sky conditions ($`r cloudtrend`\,\%/y$), suggests that cloud optical thickness is decreasing during this period.
Because we have no adequate data to investigate the long term changes of cloud thickness in the region, we cannot verify if the negative SDR trend we observe under under cloudy-skies can be attributed solely to changes in clouds.

The observed brightening on SDR over Thessaloniki is dependent on SZA (larger SZAs lead to stronger brightening).
The trend is also dependent on season, with winter showing the strongest statistically significant trend of
$`r signif(spp$"Trend [%/year]"[spp$Season == "Winter" & spp$"Sky condition" == "All sky"], 2)`$
and
$`r signif(spp$"Trend [%/year]"[spp$Season == "Winter" & spp$"Sky condition" == "Clear sky"], 2)`\,\%/y$
for all- and clear-skies, respectively, in contrast to spring and summer.
The trends for autumn are also significant but smaller (
$`r signif(spp$"Trend [%/year]"[spp$Season == "Autumn" & spp$"Sky condition" == "All sky"], 2)`$
and
$`r signif(spp$"Trend [%/year]"[spp$Season == "Autumn" & spp$"Sky condition" == "Clear sky"], 2)`\,\%/y$
for all- and clear-skies, respectively).
Our findings are in agreement with other studies for the region.

Using the CUSUMs of the monthly departures for all- and clear-skies, we observed periods where the CUSUMs remain relatively stable, with a steep decline before and a steep increase after. 
This is an indication that the whole brightening effect does not follow a smooth development over time.

Continued observations with a collocated pyrheliometer, which started in 2016, will allow us to further investigate the variability of solar radiation at ground level in Thessaloniki. 
Also, additional data of cloudiness, aerosols, atmospheric water vapour, etc., will allow better attribution and quantification of the effects of these factors on SRD.
