\abstract{The shortwave downward solar irradiance (SDR) is an important
factor that drives climate processes, production and can affect all
living organisms. While monitoring the long term variability, there are
observations of upward and downward SDR trends on different locations
around the world for different time periods. Periods of positive tredns
are refered as brightening periods and with negative tredns as dimming
periods. We studied 29 years of CHP1 data from Thessaloniki, Greece,
under three sky conditions (clear sky, cloudy sky and all sky
conditions), applying a cloud sky identification algorithm. We found a
positive trend for all-sky and clear-sky conditions, and also,
investigated the consistency of those trends, the effect of the solar
zenith angle, and the variation of the trends for the seasons of the
year. We indentified that there are some anomalies in the long term SDR
trends, for all sky conditions.}

\section{Introduction.}\label{introduction.}}

The shortwave downward solar irradiance (SDR) at Earth's surface play a
significant role, on its climate. Changes of the SDR can be related to
changes on Earth's energy budget, the mechanisms of climate change, and
water and carbon cycle \citep{Wild2009}. Can also affect, solar and
agricultural production, and all living organisms. Studies of SDR
variability, have identified some distinct SDR trends on different
regions of the world on different time periods. The term `brightening'
is generally used to describe periods of positive SDR trend, and
`dimming' for negative trend. There are many cases on the long term
records of irradiance, showing a systematic change of SDR's trend slope,
occurring roughly at the last decades of the 20th century. On multiple
station in China, a dimming period was reported until about 2000,
followed by a brightening period \citep{Yang2021}. A similar pattern was
identified, with the breaking point around 1980, for stations in Central
Europe \citep{Wild2021} and Brazil \citep{Yamasoe2021}. Also, on global
scale, an AI aided continental level spatial analysis, with data from
multiple station, reach similar conclusions for the above regions and
for the global trend \citep{Yuan2021}.

There is a consensus, among researchers, that the major factors of SDR
attenuation is the interaction of Sun radiation with atmospheric
aerosols and clouds. Those interactions, among other factors, have been
analysed with models \citep{Li2016, Samset2018}, showing the existence
of feedback mechanisms between the two. Similar finds, have been showed
in observational data \citep[ and references
therein]{Schwarz2020, Ohvril2009, Zerefos2009, Xia2007}.

Due to the variability of the phenomenon, and its contributing factors,
there is a constant need to investigate and monitor SDR, in different
sites, to estimate its magnitude, and its relation to the local
conditions. In this study, we examine the trends of SDR, with
ground-based measurements at Thessaloniki, Greece for the period 1993 to
2023, as derived from a CM-21 pyranometer. We reevaluated and extended
the dataset used by \citet{Bais2013}, applying a different algorithm for
the identification of clear-/cloud-sky instances
\citep{Reno2016, Reno2012a}, and we derive the radiation trends for the
period 1993 to 2023, under different sky conditions (all-sky, clear-sky
and cloud-sky).
