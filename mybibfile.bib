  abstract = {We present an automated algorithm for testing surface broadband radiation measurements to detect erroneous data. The methodology has been developed using data from the US Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Meas- urement (ARM) Program. The testing includes physically possible limits as determined by the World Meteorological Or- ganization (WMO) Baseline Surface Radiation Network, as well as user configurable limits based on climatological analysis of data collected at the measurement site. The algorithm can be run in near real time, or more typically on a daily basis. Additionally, longer monthly or yearly runs can be used to assess more subtle tendencies and problems in the data through evaluation of daily summaries of quality flagging.},

  abstract         = {This document describes the QCRad methodology, which uses climatological analyses of the surface
radiation measurements to define reasonable limits for testing the data for unusual data values. The main
assumption is that the majority of the climatological data are “good” data, which for field sites operated
with care such as those of the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program is a reasonable
assumption. Data that fall outside the normal range of occurrences are labeled either “indeterminate”
(meaning that the measurements are possible, but rarely occurring, and thus the values cannot be
identified as good) or “bad” depending on how far outside the normal range the particular data reside.
The methodology not only sets fairly standard maximum and minimum value limits, but also compares
what we have learned about the behavior of these instruments in the field to other value-added products
(VAPs), such as the Diffuse infrared (IR) Loss Correction VAP (Younkin and Long 2004) and the Best
Estimate Flux VAP (Shi and Long 2002).},
