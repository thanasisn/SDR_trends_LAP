## Data description 

....... span

...... measuremetns CHP1 CM21

....... screening

....... Quality assurance [cite]

Data quality for radiation measurements as described by
CN Long and Y Shi, September 2006, DOE/SC-ARM/TR-074.

Radiation Measurement Quality Control Testing Including Climatology_Long2006.pdf"

## Data preperation



Due to the large measurement assertenty near the horizon we exclude all measurements
with greater than SZA $85^\circ$. Moreover, due to nearby hills and buildings
we remove data with azimuth angle between $35^\circ$ and $120^\circ$ and SZA greater than $80^\circ$.
