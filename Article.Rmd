more about trend in relation to other trends
Aerosols and clouds

......

The shortwave downward solar irradiance (SDR) at Earth's surface play a significant role, on its climate.
Changes of the SDR can be related to changes on Earth's energy budget, the mechanisms of climate change, and water and carbon cycle [@Wild2009].
Can also affect, solar and agricultural production, and living organisms.
Studies of SDR variability, have identified some distinct SDR trends on different regions of the world and for different time periods.
The term 'brightening' is generally used to describe periods of positive SDR trend, and 'dimming' for negative trend.
There are many cases on the long term records of irradiance, showing a systematic change of SDR's trend slope, occurring roughly at the last decades of the 20th century.
<!-- Trends china -->
On multiple station in China, a dimming period was reported until about 2000, followed by a brightening period [@Yang2021]. 
<!-- Trends Europe Brazil -->
A similar pattern was identified, with the breaking point around 1980, for stations in Central Europe [@Wild2021] and Brazil [@Yamasoe2021].
<!-- Trends Global -->
Also, on global scale, an AI aided continental level spatial analysis, with data from multiple station, reach similar conclusions for the above regions and for the global trend [@Yuan2021].

There is a consensus, among researchers, that major factors of SDR attenuation is the interaction with atmospheric aerosols and clouds. 
Those interactions, among other factors, have been analysed with models [@Li2016; @Samset2018], showing the existence of feedback mechanisms between the two.
Similar finds, have been showed in observational data [@Schwarz2020; @Ohvril2009; @Zerefos2009; @Xia2007 and references therein].
<!-- Sun variability: should cite that there is no significant trend found Wild2021 -->

Due to the variability of the phenomenon, and its contributing factors, there is a need to further investigate and monitor SDR, in different sites, to estimate its magnitude, and its relation to the local conditions.
In this study, we examine the trends of SDR, with ground-based measurements at Thessaloniki, Greece for the period `r year(min(ALL_1_daily_DESEAS$Date))` to `r year(max(ALL_1_daily_DESEAS$Date))`, as derived from a CM-21 pyranometer.
<!-- goals -->
We reevaluated and extended the dataset used by @Bais2013, applying a different algorithm for the identification of clear-/cloud-sky instances [@Reno2016; @Reno2012a], and we derive the radiation trends for the period `r year(min(ALL_1_daily_DESEAS$Date))` to `r year(max(ALL_1_daily_DESEAS$Date))`, under different sky conditions (all-sky, clear-sky and cloud-sky).

Aerosols interactions

#Yang2021  Cloud “shrinking” and “optical thinning” in the “dimming” period and a subsequent recovery in the “brightening” period over China

Aerosols not only strengthen but also weaken the
growth of clouds with respect to their coverage and
optical thickness, depending on the levels of pollution
and the associated amounts of aerosols as postulated
in a conceptual framework (Wild 2009a, 2012, Yang
et al 2012).

# Observational data and methodology.

The SDR data were measured with a Kipp & Zonen CM-21 pyranometer operating continuously at the Laboratory of Atmospheric Physics of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki 
($40^\circ\,38'\,$N, $22^\circ\,57'\,$E, $80\,$m\ a.s.l.)
in the period from 
<!-- \mbox{ -->
`r min(ALL_1_daily_DESEAS$Date)`
<!-- } -->
to
<!-- \mbox{ -->
`r max(ALL_1_daily_DESEAS$Date)`.
<!-- }. -->
The monitoring site is located near the city centre, and we expect to be affected by the urban environment. 
During the study period, the pyranometer has been independently calibrated three times at the Meteorologisches Observatorium Lindenberg, DWD, when it was verified the stability of the instrument to within better than $0.7\%$ relative to the initial calibration by the manufacturer. 
Along with SDR, the direct beam radiation (DNI) was also measured by a collocated Kipp & Zonen CHP-1 pyrheliometer, for the period
<!-- \mbox{ -->
`r min(ALL_1_daily_DESEAS[!is.na(DIR_att), Date])`
<!-- } -->
to
<!-- \mbox{ -->
`r max(ALL_1_daily_DESEAS[!is.na(DIR_att), Date])`.
<!-- }. -->
Although, we have performed a similar analysis to the DNI data the results are not presented here, as they lack the appropriate statistical significance, due to the sorter duration of the data. 
However, the DNI data were used as auxiliary data, in the clear sky identification algorithm (CSid), which is discussed later, for the selection of the appropriate thresholds.
It is noted that despite the capability of the CSid algorithm to use the DNI as a characterization parameter, we haven't used it here, to avoid any selection bias due to unequal length of the two datasets. 
There are three distinct steps in the creation of the dataset analysed here:
a)\ the acquisition of radiation measurements from the sensors,
b)\ the data quality check,
c)\ the identification of "clear sky" conditions from the radiometric data, and d)\ the aggregation of data and trend analysis.

Northern Greece has been selected because it is well known to be located at the crossroads of aerosols and various pollutants pathways originating in central and Eastern
Europe (Lelieveld et al., 2002; Zerefos et al., 2002). Thessa-
loniki, the major city in northern Greece, lies along the exit of air
pollutants from Europe, in the path of the prevailing long-range
transport (LRT) trajectories, as we move from central and east-
ern Europe to the Mediterranean (Zerefos et. al., 2002). On the
-->

<!-- a) acquisition -->
For the acquisition of radiometric data, the signal of the pyranometer is sampled with a rate of $1\,\text{Hz}$.
The mean and the standard deviation of these samples are recorded every minute.
The measurements are corrected for the zero offset (dark signal in volts).
The "dark signal" is calculated by averaging all measurements recorded for a period of 
$3\,\text{h}$ 
before (morning) or after (evening), when the Sun reaches an elevation angle of
$-10^\circ$.
The signal is converted to irradiance using a ramped value of the instrument’s sensitivity between the calibrations.

<!-- b) Radiation data quality check -->
A manual screening was performed, to remove inconsistent and erroneous recordings that can occur stochastically or systematically, during the continuous operation of the instruments.
The manual screening is aided by a radiation data quality assurance procedure, adjusted for the site, which is based on the methods of 
Long and Shi\ [-@Long2008a; -@Long2006].
Thus, problematic recordings have been excluded from further processing. 
Although it is impossible to detect all false data, the large number of available data, and the aggregation scheme we used, ensures the good quality of the radiometric measurements used in this study.

<!-- c) Clear sky identification -->
In order to be able to estimate the effect of the clouds on the long term variability of SDR, we created three datasets, by characterizing each one-minute measurement with a corresponding sky condition (i.e., all-sky, clear-sky and cloudy-sky).
To identify the clear-sky conditions we used the method proposed by
@Long2000
and by
@Reno2016,
which was adapted and configured for the site, as the authors suggest.

<!-- CS subjectivity -->
We have to note, that the definition of what constitutes as clear or cloudy sky, has some subjectivity, in this method of characterization.
As a result, the details of the definition is site specific, it relies on a combination of thresholds and comparisons with ideal actinometric models and statistical analysis on different signal metrics.
The CSid algorithm was calibrated with the main focus to identify the presence of clouds on the sky dome, although few marginal cases exist that have been identified as false positive or false negative, but cannot affect the results of the study.

For completeness, we will provide a brief overview of the CSid process, along with the site specific thresholds.
As a reference clear sky SDR, we are using the radiation model by Haurwitz’s, adjusted for our site with a factor $a$, resulting by an iterative optimization process, as described by @Long2000 and @Reno2016.
The target of the optimization was the minimization of the function $f(a)$ (Eq.\ \ref{eq:minf}) and was accomplished with the computing function `stats::optimise` [@RCT2023], based on work by @Brent1973.
The optimization and the selection of the clear sky reference model, was performed on SDR observations for the period 2016 – 2021.
During the optimization, eight simple clear sky radiation models were tested (Daneshyar–Paltridge–Proctor, Kasten–Czeplak, Haurwitz, Berger–Duffie, Adnot–Bourges–Campana–Gicquel, Robledo-Soler, Kasten and Ineichen-Perez), with a wide range of factors. We found, that Haurwitz’s model, adjusted with the factor $a = `r signif(alpha,3)`$ has one of the lowest root mean squared error (RMSE), while correlates with large amount of our data. Thus, our clear sky reference is the Eq.\ \ref{eq:ahau}. 
The tried models are described in more details by @Reno2012 and evaluated by @Reno2016.

<!-- cost fuction -->
\begin{equation}
f(a)=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}( \text{SDR}_{\text{CSid},i} - a \times \text{SDR}_{\text{testCSref},i})^2 \label{eq:minf}
\end{equation}

<!-- adjusted Haurwitz -->
\begin{equation}
\text{SDR}_\text{CSref} = a \times \text{SDR}_\text{Haurwitz}  = `r signif(alpha,3)` \times 1098 \times \cos( \text{SZA} ) \times \exp \left( \frac{ - 0.057}{\cos(\text{SZA})} \right) \label{eq:ahau}
\end{equation}


The following criteria and thresholds were used to identify clear-sky conditions.
Each criterion was applied for a running window of $`r nt`$ consecutive measurements/minutes, and the characterization is applied at the center value of the window.
A data point is consider as under cloud-sky condition if it fails to pass any of the criteria, the rest data points are characterized as clear-sky.


<!-- 1. MeanVIP -->
<!-- ### Mean value of irradiance during the time period. -->

The mean of the measured value $\overline{\text{SDR}}_i = \text{mean}_{n=i-5}^{n=i+5}[\text{SDR}_{n}]$ must be inside an envelope based on the equivalent mean of the reference model $\overline{\text{SDR}}_\text{CSref} = \text{mean}_{n=i-5}^{n=i+5}[\text{SDR}_{\text{CSref},n}]$ (Eq. \ref{eq:MeanVIP}).

\begin{equation}
`r 1 - CS_ref_rm_VIP_RelLow` \times \overline{\text{SDR}}_{\text{CSref},i} - `r CS_ref_rm_VIP_LowOff`
< \overline{SDR}_i <
`r 1 + CS_ref_rm_VIP_RelUpp` \times \overline{\text{SDR}}_{\text{CSref},i} + `r CS_ref_rm_VIP_UppOff`
\label{eq:MeanVIP}
\end{equation}


<!-- 2. MaxVIP -->
<!-- ### Max value of irradiance during the time period. -->

The running max measured value $M_{\text{SDR},i} = \max_{n=i-5}^{n=i+5}[\text{SDR}_{n}]$, is compared to a similar constructed value from the reference $M_{CSi} = \max_{n=i-5}^{n=i+5}[\text{SDR}_{\text{CSref},n}]$ (Eq.\ \ref{eq:MaxVIP}).

\begin{equation}
`r MaxVIP_fct` \times M_{CSi} - `r MaxVIP_off_low`
< M_{\text{SDR},i} <
`r MaxVIP_fct` \times M_{CSi} + `r MaxVIP_off_upp`
\label{eq:MaxVIP}
\end{equation}


<!-- 3. VIL -->
<!-- ### Variability in irradiance by line length. -->

The length $L$ of the sequence of line segments, connecting the points of the SDR time series for the measured values (Eq.\ \ref{eq:VILeq}), and similar for the reference $L_{CS}$, must be within the limits of Eq. \ref{eq:VILcr}.

\begin{equation}
L_i = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\sqrt{\left ( \text{SDR}_{i+1} - \text{SDR}_{i}\right )^2 + \left ( t_{i+1} - t_i \right )^2}
\label{eq:VILeq}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
`r MinVIL_fct` \times L_{CSi} - `r offVIL_dwl` < L_i < `r MaxVIL_fct` \times L_{CSi} + `r offVIL_upl`
\label{eq:VILcr}
\end{equation}


<!-- 4. VCT -->
<!-- ### Variance of Changes in the Time series. -->

<!-- Standard deviation of rate of change in irradiance. -->
The standard deviation $\sigma$ of the slope ($s$) between sequential points in the time series, normalized by the average SDR during the time interval, must be below a threshold (Eq.\ \ref{eq:VCTcr}).

<!--
\begin{gather}
s_i = \frac{\text{SDR}_{i+1} - \text{SDR}_{i}}{t_{i+1} - t_i}, \forall i \in \left \{ 1, 2, \ldots, n-1 \right \} \label{eq:VCT1} \\
\bar{s} = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} s_i \label{eq:VCT2} \\
\sigma_i = \frac {\sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \left( s_i - \bar{s} \right)^2} } {\bar{G_i}} \label{eq:VCT3}
\end{gather}
-->

\begin{equation}
s_i = \frac{\text{SDR}_{i+1} - \text{SDR}_{i}}{t_{i+1} - t_i}, \forall i \in \left \{ 1, 2, \ldots, n-1 \right \},\;\;
\bar{s} = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} s_i,\;\;
\sigma_i = \frac {\sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \left( s_i - \bar{s} \right)^2} } {\bar{G_i}} \label{eq:VCT3b}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\sigma_i < `r offVCT`
\label{eq:VCTcr}
\end{equation}


<!-- 5. VSM -->
<!-- ### Variability in the Shape of the irradiance Measurements. -->

The maximum difference $X$ between the change in measured irradiance and the change in clear sky irradiance over each measurement interval, must be lower than a threshold (Eq.\ \ref{eq:VSMcr}).

\begin{gather}
x_i = \text{SDR}_{i+1} - \text{SDR}_{i} \forall i \in \left \{ 1, 2, \ldots, n-1 \right \} \label{eq:VSM1} \\
x_{\text{CSref},i} = \text{SDR}_{\text{CSref},i+1} - \text{SDR}_{\text{CSref},i} \forall i \in \left \{ 1, 2, \ldots, n-1 \right \} \label{eq:VSM2} \\
X_i = \max{\left \{ \left | x_i - x_{\text{CSref},i} \right | \right \}} \label{eq:VSM3}
\end{gather}

\begin{equation}
X_i < `r offVSM`
\label{eq:VSMcr}
\end{equation}


<!-- ### Data selection -->
Due to a significant measurement uncertainty near the horizon, we have to exclude all measurements with SZA greater than $`r 90-MIN_ELEVA`^\circ$. 
Moreover, due to some obstructions around the site (hills and buildings), we excluded data with Azimuth angle between 
$35^\circ$ and $120^\circ$ with SZA greater than $80^\circ$.
On the latter instances, Sun is systematically, not visible by the instrument's location.
<!-- 1au -->
To make the measurements comparable throughout the dataset, we adjusted all 1-minute radiometric values to the mean Sun - Earth distance.
<!-- TSI -->
Subsequently, we made all measurements relative to the Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) at $1\,\text{au}$, in order to compensate for the Sun's intensity variability, using a homogenized time series of satellite TSI observations.
The TSI data we use, comes from NOAA [@Coddington2005], it overlaps with our data, and is interpolated to match with the time step of the data.
<!-- The TSI data we use, is a combination of data from NOAA [@Coddington2005] (for `r as.Date(TSIinfo[TSI_Source == "NOAA", Start])` - `r as.Date(TSIinfo[TSI_Source == "NOAA", End])`) and adjusted data from @LASP2023 (for `r as.Date(TSIinfo[TSI_Source != "NOAA", Start])` - `r as.Date(TSIinfo[TSI_Source != "NOAA", End])`).-->
As a result, we can present all radiation data as a fraction of Sun's TSI. 
After the preparation of the data, we have $`r SDR_N_All`$  1-minute measurements, of which,
$`r signif(100 * SDR_N_Clear / SDR_N_All, 3)`\%$ 
are characterized with clear-sky condition, and the rest 
$`r signif(100 * SDR_N_Cloud / SDR_N_All, 3)`\%$
with cloud-sky conditions.

<!-- aggregation -->
In order to investigate the SDR trend, we implement an appropriate aggregation scheme of the 1-minute data to a coarser time scale. To preserve the representativeness we are using the following criteria:
a) for daily mean values we exclude days with less than `r Daily_aggregation_N_lim` valid data points,
b) accordingly, monthly values are computed by daily means, and months with less than `r Monthly_aggegation_N_lim` days are omitted. 
To create the daily and monthly seasonal values, we group the data based on the day of year number, and the corresponding calendar month respectively.
<!-- Seasonal -->
For the seasons of the year trends, we grouped the mean daily values by the corresponding season (Winter: December - February, Spring: March - May, etc.).
<!-- Deseasonalization -->
Finally, for each data set, we remove the natural occurring seasonal variation, by calculating the mean values for the appropriate time step, and subtracting the annual cycle from the actual data.
<!-- SZA Deseasonalization -->
To estimate Sun's SZA contribution to the SDR brightening, the 1-minute data were aggregate in $1^\circ$ SZA bins, separated for instances before and after the local noon, and then was deseasonalized as above. 
Thus, for each dataset we have obtained the relative departure of the seasonal mean.


# Results

## Long-term SDR trends

We calculated the SDR trends, from the mean daily values of the departure from the seasonal values, for the whole time series for the three sky conditions (Table\ \ref{tab:trendtable}).
We present only the plot for the trend under all-sky conditions (Figure\ \ref{fig:trendALL}), as the plots for clear-sky condition and cloud-sky condition, are very similar.
In the studied time period, there is no significant break or change in the variability of the overall trends.
Other studies for the European region are reporting a change of the SDR slope, around the 1980, few years before the start of our records [@Wild2021; @Yuan2021; @Ohmura2009].

On all three plots on Figure\ \ref{fig:cumsum}, we observe a step downward part at the start of the period until about 2000, an almost steady part until about 2016 for All-sky and Clear-sky conditions (Figures\ \ref{fig:cumsum-1}, \ref{fig:cumsum-2}), and until 2009 for Cloud-sky conditions (Figure\ \ref{fig:cumsum-3}), and finally, a steep upward part until the present.
For a more uniform trend, we expect the cumulative sum plot of the anomaly, to have a symmetric 'V' shape.
In our case, for all sky conditions we observe a period where the cumulative remain relative steady.
This indicates, that the anomaly was evenly distributed around the climatological mean.
Another distinct feature of the cumulative plots, is the difference, between the sky conditions, of the start of the sums sudden increase, for the latter part of the period.
This can make us to suspected that clear-Sky conditions SDR and cloud-sky SDR is affected by different mechanisms.


```{r cumsum, echo = FALSE, fig.cap='Running cumulative sum plots of the daily SDR for three different sky conditions', fig.subcap=c('All-sky conditions', 'Clear-sky conditions', 'Cloud-sky conditions'), out.width='.32\\linewidth', fig.asp=1, fig.ncol = 3}
knitr::include_graphics(c(
    "./images/CumulativeDailyCumSum-1.png",    # ALL sky
    "./images/CumulativeDailyCumSum-5.png",    # CLEAR sky
    "./images/CumulativeDailyCumSum-9.png"))   # Cloud sky
```

## Effects of the solar zenith angle on SDR.

.... cite paper about low elevation SDR .....

The relative position of the Sun in the sky, seem to be a major drive of the attenuation of SDR, as it is affect 

... Aerosols and clouds ...

We group the anomaly data in $1^\circ$ SZA bins, and calculated the overall trend for each bin 

Analyzing the long term trends of SDR to bins of SZA, we can see the contribution of the geometry and time in a diurnal level (Figures\ \ref{fig:szatrends}a and \ref{fig:szatrends}b). Although there is a seasonal distribution of SZA than in not presented here.


```{r szatrends, echo = FALSE, fig.cap='Distribution of the SDR\'s long term trends by SZA.', fig.subcap=c('All-sky conditions.', 'Clear-sky conditions.', 'Cloud-sky conditions.'), out.width='.35\\linewidth', out.width='.32\\linewidth', fig.asp=1, fig.ncol = 3}

## Long term trends by season of year


Similar we have produced the deseasonalized trend for different sky conditions for each season of the year, using the corresponding mean monthly values.
This can give us a better understanding of the annual variability of the trends.

```{r seasonalALL, echo=F, fig.cap="Trends by season for all condition. Displaying monthly means of daily means.", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/SeasonalTrendsTogether-1.png")
```

<!-- ```{r seasonalCLOUD, echo=F, fig.cap="Trends by season for Cloudy-sky condition. Displays monthly means of daily means."} -->

## Consistency of the trends

A method to evaluate changes in the long term trend is to use the cumulative sum of the variable.

# Conclusions

Our result for all-sky condition ($`r alltrend`\%/year$), reaffirm the previous results of @Bais2013 for the site.
The increase of this trend, shows that the phenomenon and probably the causes have been amplified.

.....
Also, the trend of $`r cloudtrend`\%/year$ for cloud-sky condition indicate the major part that clouds play on the
