The shortwave downward solar irradiance (SDR) at Earth's surface play a significant role, on it's climate.
Changes of the SDR can be related to changes on Earth's energy budget, the mechanisms of climate change, and water and carbon cycle [@Wild2009].
Can also affect, solar and agricultural production, and living organisms.
Studies of SDR variability, have identified some distinct SDR trends on different regions of the world and for different time periods.
The term 'brightening' is generally used to describe periods of positive SDR trend, and 'dimming' for negative trend.
There are many cases on the long term records of irradiance, showing a systematic change of SDR's trend slope, occurring roughly at the last decades of the 20th century.
<!-- Trends china -->
On multiple station in China, a dimming period was reported until about 2000, followed by a brightening period [@Yang2021]. 
<!-- Trends Europe Brazil -->
A similar pattern was identified, with the breaking point around 1980, for stations in Central Europe [@Wild2021] and Brazil [@Yamasoe2021].
<!-- Trends Global -->
Also, on global scale, an AI aided continental level spatial analysis, with data from multiple station, reach similar conclusions for the above regions and for the global trend [@Yuan2021].

There is a consensus, among researchers, that major factors of SDR attenuation is the interaction with atmospheric aerosols and clouds. 
Those interactions, among other factors, have been analysed with models [@Li2016; @Samset2018], showing the existence of feedback mechanisms between the two.
Similar finds, have been showed in observational data [@Schwarz2020; @Ohvril2009; @Zerefos2009; @Xia2007 and references therein].
<!-- Sun variability: should cite that there is no significant trend found Wild2021 -->

Due to the variability of the phenomenon, and its contributing factors, there is a need to further investigate and monitor SDR, in different sites, to estimate its magnitude, and its relation to the local conditions.
In this study, we examine the trends of SDR, with ground-based measurements at Thessaloniki, Greece for the period `r year(min(ALL_1_daily_DESEAS$Date))` to `r year(max(ALL_1_daily_DESEAS$Date))`, as derived from a CM-21 pyranometer.
<!-- goals -->
We reevaluated and extended the dataset used by @Bais2013, applying a different algorithm for the identification of clear-/cloud-sky instances [@Reno2016; @Reno2012a], and we derive the radiation trends for the period `r year(min(ALL_1_daily_DESEAS$Date))` to `r year(max(ALL_1_daily_DESEAS$Date))`, under different sky conditions (all-sky, clear-sky and cloud-sky).

Aerosols interactions

#Yang2021  Cloud “shrinking” and “optical thinning” in the “dimming” period and a subsequent recovery in the “brightening” period over China

Aerosols not only strengthen but also weaken the
growth of clouds with respect to their coverage and
optical thickness, depending on the levels of pollution
and the associated amounts of aerosols as postulated
in a conceptual framework (Wild 2009a, 2012, Yang
et al 2012).

# Observational data and methodology.


<!-- time span -->
The SDR is equivalent to the whole sky Global radiation (or Global Horizontal Irradiance, GHI), and was obtained with a horizontal leveled, CM-21 pyranometer, from 
<!-- \mbox{ -->
`r min(ALL_1_daily_DESEAS$Date)`
<!-- } -->
to
<!-- \mbox{ -->
`r max(ALL_1_daily_DESEAS$Date)`.
<!-- }. -->
Also, we have measurements of direct beam radiation (DNI) obtained by a collocated CHP-1 pyrheliometer, from 
<!-- \mbox{ -->
`r min(ALL_1_daily_DESEAS[!is.na(DIR_att), Date])`
<!-- } -->
to
<!-- \mbox{ -->
`r max(ALL_1_daily_DESEAS[!is.na(DIR_att), Date])`.
<!-- }. -->
Although, we performed a similar analysis to the DNI as for the SDR, the results are not presented here, as they lack the appropriate statistical significance, due to the sorter duration of the data.
Moreover, the DNI was used as auxiliary data, with the clear sky identification algorithm (CSid), to aid with the selection of the appropriate thresholds. 
We have to note also, that despite the capability of the CSid to use the DNI as an characterization parameter, we haven't use it, to avoid any selection bias due to unequal availability of measurements.

<!-- Location -->

The SDR data were measured with a Kipp & Zonen CM-21 pyranometer operating continuously at the Laboratory of Atmospheric Physics of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki ($40^\circ38'$N, $22^\circ57'$E, 80m\ a.s.l.).
The monitoring site is located near the city centre.
During the study period the CM-21 pyranometer has been independently calibrated four times.
<!-- Preparation. -->
There are three distinct steps to the creation of this dataset:
a)\ the acquisition of radiation measurements from the sensors, 
b)\ a radiation data quality check,
c)\ the identification of "clear sky" conditions from the radiometric data, and
d)\ data aggregation and trend analysis.

Northern Greece has been selected because it is well known to be located at the crossroads of aerosols and various pollutants pathways originating in central and Eastern
Europe (Lelieveld et al., 2002; Zerefos et al., 2002). Thessa-
loniki, the major city in northern Greece, lies along the exit of air
pollutants from Europe, in the path of the prevailing long-range

<!-- a) Acquisition -->
For the acquisition of radiometric data,
the signal of the broadband instruments is sampled with a rate of $1 \text{Hz}$. The mean and its standard deviation are recorded for every minute.
<!-- dark correction -->
The measurements are corrected for the zero offset of the instrument signal.
As reference of the "dark signal" is used the Sun elevation angle bellow $-10^\circ$, for a period of $3 \text{h}$.
<!-- physical quantities -->
The signal is converted to radiation flux, using a ramped value of the instrument sensitivity, derived from the eight laboratory calibrations of the instrument, during the study period.

<!-- b) Radiation data quality check -->
<!-- The radiation quality is assured with a manual screening, aided by an automatic assessment process. -->
<!-- screening -->
A manual screening was performed, to remove inconsistencies and erroneous recordings, that can occur randomly or systematically, during the long continuous operation of the instrument.
<!-- Quality assurance -->
The manual screening is aided by a radiation data quality assurance procedure, adjusted for this site, based on methods of Long and Shi\ [-@Long2008a; -@Long2006].
Thus, problematic recordings have been excluded from further processing. 
Although it is not possible to detect all the bad data, the large number of data and the aggregation scheme we use, can provide us with accurate radiometric measurements, for the scope of this study.


<!-- c) Clear sky identification -->
In order to estimate the effect of the clouds on the SDR, we created three datasets, by characterizing each one-minute measurement with a corresponding sky condition. 
The all-sky conditions, containing all the valid measurements. 
The clear-sky conditions data, correspond to data where we have inferred that the sky was almost clear of clouds, and the remainder part the data was characterized with cloud sky conditions (cloud-sky). 
To identify the clear-sky conditions we used the method proposed by @Long2000 and by @Reno2016, that was adapted and configured for the site.

<!-- CS subjectivity -->
We have to note, that the definition of what constitutes as clear or cloudy sky, has some subjectivity, due to the used method of characterization.
As a result, the details of the definition are site specific, it relies on a combination of threshold of comparisons with ideal actinometric models and statistics on different signal behavior.


<!-- basic concepts -->
The algorithm was calibrated with the main focus to identify the presence of clouds on the sky dome, although there are marginal cases that there will be false positives or false negatives identifications.

<!-- # Detection of clear periods in GHI measurements for SDR trends. -->

As global radiation clear sky reference we are using the Haurwitz’s model, adjusted for our site with a factor of `r signif(alpha,3)` (Eq.\ \ref{eq:ahau}).
The selection of a clear sky reference model, was based on SDR observation from the period 2016 – 2021.
Where, after an iterative optimization of eight simple models (Daneshyar–Paltridge–Proctor, Kasten–Czeplak, Haurwitz, Berger–Duffie, Adnot–Bourges–Campana–Gicquel, Robledo-Soler, Kasten and Ineichen-Perez) with different factors.
We found, that Haurwitz’s model, adjusted with a factor of `r signif(alpha,3)` has the lower root mean squared error (RMSE). 
The tried models are described by @Reno2012 and tested by @Reno2016.
The iterative optimization method, for the selection of the reference is discussed by @Long2000 and @Reno2016.

\begin{equation}
\text{SDR}_\text{Clear Sky} = `r signif(alpha,3)` \times 1098 \times \cos( \text{SZA} ) \times \exp \left( \frac{ - 0.057}{\cos(\text{SZA})} \right) \label{eq:ahau}
\end{equation}



The following criteria and thresholds were used to identify clear-sky conditions.
Each criterion was applied for a running window of $`r nt`$ consecutive measurements/minutes, and the characterization is applied at the center value of the window.
A data point is consider as under cloud-sky condition if it fails to pass any of the criteria, all the other data points are characterized as clear-sky.


<!-- 1. MeanVIP -->
<!-- ### Mean value of irradiance during the time period. -->

The mean of the measured value $\overline{G}_i$ must be inside an envelope based on the reference model $\text{SDR}_\text{Clear Sky}$ (Eq. \ref{eq:MeanVIP}).

\begin{equation}
`r 1 - CS_ref_rm_VIP_RelLow` \times \overline{\text{SDR}}_{i\text{Clear Sky}} - `r CS_ref_rm_VIP_LowOff`
< \overline{G}_i <
`r 1 + CS_ref_rm_VIP_RelUpp` \times \overline{\text{SDR}}_{i\text{Clear Sky}} + `r CS_ref_rm_VIP_UppOff`
\label{eq:MeanVIP}
\end{equation}


<!-- 2. MaxVIP -->
<!-- ### Max value of irradiance during the time period. -->

The running max measured value $M_{Gi} = max[\text{SDR}_{i}]$, is compared to a similar constructed value from the reference $M_{CSi} = max[\text{SDR}_{i\text{Clear Sky}}]$ (Eq.\ \ref{eq:MaxVIP}).

\begin{equation}
`r MaxVIP_fct` \times M_{CSi} - `r MaxVIP_off_low`
< M_{Gi} <
`r MaxVIP_fct` \times M_{CSi} + `r MaxVIP_off_upp`
\label{eq:MaxVIP}
\end{equation}


<!-- 3. VIL -->
<!-- ### Variability in irradiance by line length. -->

The length $L$ (Eq. \ref{eq:VILeq}) of the sequence of line segments connecting the points of the SDR time
series for the measured values $L$ and similar for the reference $L_{CS}$, must be within the limits of Eq. \ref{eq:VILcr}.

\begin{equation}
L = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\sqrt{\left ( \text{SDR}_{i+1} - \text{SDR}_{i}\right )^2 + \left ( t_{i+1} - t_i \right )^2}
\label{eq:VILeq}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
`r MinVIL_fct` \times L_{CSi} - `r offVIL_dwl` < L_i < `r MaxVIL_fct` \times L_{CSi} + `r offVIL_upl`
\label{eq:VILcr}
\end{equation}


<!-- 4. VCT -->
<!-- ### Variance of Changes in the Time series. -->

<!-- Standard deviation of rate of change in irradiance. -->
We calculate the standard deviation $\sigma$ of the slope
($s$) between sequential points in the time series, normalized by the average SDR during the time interval.

<!--
\begin{gather}
s_i = \frac{\text{SDR}_{i+1} - \text{SDR}_{i}}{t_{i+1} - t_i}, \forall i \in \left \{ 1, 2, \ldots, n-1 \right \} \label{eq:VCT1} \\
\bar{s} = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} s_i \label{eq:VCT2} \\
\sigma_i = \frac {\sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \left( s_i - \bar{s} \right)^2} } {\bar{G_i}} \label{eq:VCT3}
\end{gather}
-->

\begin{equation}
s_i = \frac{\text{SDR}_{i+1} - \text{SDR}_{i}}{t_{i+1} - t_i}, \forall i \in \left \{ 1, 2, \ldots, n-1 \right \},\;\;
\bar{s} = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} s_i,\;\;
\sigma_i = \frac {\sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \left( s_i - \bar{s} \right)^2} } {\bar{G_i}} \label{eq:VCT3b}
\end{equation}



\begin{equation}
\sigma_i < `r offVCT`
\label{eq:VCTcr}
\end{equation}


<!-- 5. VSM -->
<!-- ### Variability in the Shape of the irradiance Measurements. -->

The maximum difference $X$ between the change in measured irradiance and the change in clear sky
irradiance over each measurement interval.

\begin{gather}
x_i = \text{SDR}_{i+1} - \text{SDR}_{i} \forall i \in \left \{ 1, 2, \ldots, n-1 \right \} \label{eq:VSM1} \\
x_{CS,i} = \text{SDR}_{CS,i+1} - \text{SDR}_{CS,i} \forall i \in \left \{ 1, 2, \ldots, n-1 \right \} \label{eq:VSM2} \\
X_i = \max{\left \{ \left | x_i - x_{CS,i} \right | \right \}} \label{eq:VSM3}
\end{gather}

\begin{equation}
X_i < `r offVSM`
\label{eq:VSMcr}
\end{equation}






<!-- ### Data selection -->
Due to a significant measurement uncertainty near, the horizon, we have to exclude
all measurements with SZA greater than $`r 90-MIN_ELEVA`^\circ$. 
Moreover, due to some obstructions around the site (hills and buildings), we excluded data with Azimuth angle between 
$35^\circ$ and $120^\circ$ with SZA greater than $80^\circ$.
On the latter instances, Sun is systematically, not visible by the instrument's location.
<!-- 1au -->
To make the measurements comparable throughout the dataset, we adjusted all 1-minute radiometric values to the mean Sun - Earth distance.
<!-- TSI -->
Subsequently, we made all measurements relative to the Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) at $1 \text{au}$, in order to compensate for the Sun's intensity variability, using a homogenized time series of satellite TSI observations.
The TSI data we use, comes from NOAA [@Coddington2005], it overlaps with our data, and is interpolated to match with the time step of the data.
<!-- The TSI data we use, is a combination of data from NOAA [@Coddington2005] (for `r as.Date(TSIinfo[TSI_Source == "NOAA", Start])` - `r as.Date(TSIinfo[TSI_Source == "NOAA", End])`) and adjusted data from @LASP2023 (for `r as.Date(TSIinfo[TSI_Source != "NOAA", Start])` - `r as.Date(TSIinfo[TSI_Source != "NOAA", End])`).-->
As a result, we can present all radiation data as a fraction of Sun's TSI.

### Aggregation of radiometric data

<!-- aggregation -->
Before further analysis and deseasonalization, we implement an appropriate aggregation scheme on the 1-minute data. To preserve the representativeness we use the following criteria:
a) for daily mean values we exclude instances with less than `r Daily_aggregation_N_lim` valid data points,
b) accordingly, monthly values are computed by daily aggregated data, where months with less than `r Monthly_aggegation_N_lim` days are rejected. 
The daily seasonal values were indexed based on the day of year number, and the monthly by the corresponding calendar month.
<!-- Seasonal -->
For the seasons of the year trends, we grouped the mean daily values by season (December - February: Winter, March - May: Spring, etc.).
<!-- Deseasonalization -->
Finally, for each data set, we remove the natural occurring seasonal variation.
This is done, by calculating the mean values for the appropriate time step, and subtracting the annual cycle from the actual data.
<!-- SZA Deseasonalization -->
In addition to the previous aggregation scheme, each dataset was aggregate in $1^\circ$ SZA bins, separate for cases before and after local noon. 
This gave us an approximation of Sun's SZA contribution to the SDR brightening. 

Thus, for each data set we have obtained the relative departure of the seasonal mean.
The statistical significance and aggregation scheme and filtering will be noted along with the corresponding results.


# Results

## Long-term SDR trends

We calculated the SDR trends, from the mean daily values of the departure from the seasonal values, for the whole time series for the three sky conditions (Table\ \ref{tab:trendtable}).

## Long term trends by Solar zenith angle.

Analyzing the long term trends of SDR to bins of SZA, we can see the contribution of the geometry and time in a diurnal level (Figures\ \ref{fig:szatrends}a and \ref{fig:szatrends}b). Although there is a seasonal distribution of SZA than in not presented here.

## Consistency of the trends

A method to evaluate changes in the long term trend is to use the cumulative sum of the variable.

# Conclusions

Our result for all-sky condition ($`r alltrend`\%/year$), reaffirm the previous results of @Bais2013 for the site.
The increase of this trend, shows that the phenomenon and probably the causes have been amplified.

.....
Also, the trend of $`r cloudtrend`\%/year$ for cloud-sky condition indicate the major part that clouds play on the
