\section{Introduction.}\label{introduction.}}

The shortwave downward solar irradiance (SDR) at Earth's surface play a significant role, on it's climate.
Changes of the SDR can be related to changes on Earth's energy budget, the mechanisms of climate change, and water and carbon cycle (Wild 2009).
Can also affect, solar and agricultural production, and living organisms.
Studies of SDR variability, have identified some distinct SDR trends on different regions of the world and for different time periods.
The term `brightening' is generally used to describe periods of positive SDR trend, and `dimming' for negative trend.
There are many cases on the long term records of irradiance, showing a systematic change of SDR's trend slope, occurring roughly at the last decades of the 20th century.
On multiple station in China, a dimming period was reported until about 2000, followed by a brightening period (Yang et al. 2021).
A similar pattern was identified, with the breaking point around 1980, for stations in Central Europe (Wild et al. 2021) and Brazil (Yamasoe et al. 2021).
Also, on global scale, an AI aided continental level spatial analysis, with data from multiple station, reach similar conclusions for the above regions and for the global trend (Yuan, Leirvik, and Wild 2021).

There is a consensus, among researchers, that major factors of SDR attenuation is the interaction with atmospheric aerosols and clouds.
Those interactions, among other factors, have been analysed with models (Li et al. 2016; Samset et al. 2018), showing the existence of feedback mechanisms between the two.
Similar finds, have been showed in observational data (Schwarz et al. 2020; Ohvril et al. 2009; Zerefos et al. 2009; Xia et al. 2007 and references therein).

Due to the variability of the phenomenon, and its contributing factors, there is a need to further investigate and monitor SDR, in different sites, to estimate its magnitude, and its relation to the local conditions.
In this study, we examine the trends of SDR, with ground-based measurements at Thessaloniki, Greece for the period 1993 to 2023, as derived from a CM-21 pyranometer.
We reevaluated and extended the dataset used by Bais et al. (2013), applying a different algorithm for the identification of clear-/cloud-sky instances (Reno and Hansen 2016; Reno, Hansen, and Stein 2012a), and we derive the radiation trends for the period 1993 to 2023, under different sky conditions (all-sky, clear-sky and cloud-sky).

\hypertarget{observational-data-and-methodology.}{%
\section{Observational data and methodology.}\label{observational-data-and-methodology.}}

The SDR is equivalent to the whole sky Global radiation (or Global Horizontal Irradiance, GHI), and was obtained with a horizontal leveled, CM-21 pyranometer, from
1993-04-12
to
2023-03-31.
Also, we have measurements of direct beam radiation (DNI) obtained by a collocated CHP-1 pyrheliometer, from
2016-04-01
to
2023-03-31.
Although, we performed a similar analysis to the DNI as for the SDR, the results are not presented here, as they lack the appropriate statistical significance, due to the sorter duration of the data.
Moreover, the DNI was used as auxiliary data, with the clear sky identification algorithm (CSid), to aid with the selection of the appropriate thresholds.
We have to note also, that despite the capability of the CSid to use the DNI as an characterization parameter, we haven't use it, to avoid any selection bias due to unequal availability of measurements.

The SDR data were measured with a Kipp \& Zonen CM-21 pyranometer operating continuously at the Laboratory of Atmospheric Physics of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (\(40^\circ38'\)N, \(22^\circ57'\)E, 80m a.s.l.).
The monitoring site is located near the city centre.
During the study period the CM-21 pyranometer has been independently calibrated four times.
There are three distinct steps to the creation of this dataset:
a) the acquisition of radiation measurements from the sensors,
b) a radiation data quality check, and
c) the identification of ``clear sky'' conditions from the radiometric data
d) data aggregation and trend analysis.

For the acquisition of radiometric data,
the signal of the broadband instruments is sampled with a rate of \(1 \text{Hz}\). The mean and its standard deviation are recorded for every minute.
The measurements are corrected for the zero offset of the instrument signal.
As reference of the ``dark signal'' is used the Sun elevation angle bellow \(-10^\circ\), for a period of \(3 \text{h}\).
The signal is converted to radiation flux, using a ramped value of the instrument sensitivity, derived from the eight laboratory calibrations of the instrument, during the study period.

A manual screening was performed, to remove inconsistencies and erroneous recordings, that can occur randomly or systematically, during the long continuous operation of the instrument.
The manual screening is aided by a radiation data quality assurance procedure, adjusted for this site, based on methods of Long and Shi~(2008, 2006).
Thus, problematic recordings have been excluded from further processing.
Although it is not possible to detect all the bad data, the large number of data and the aggregation scheme we use, can provide us with accurate radiometric measurements, for the scope of this study.

In order to estimate the effect of the clouds on the SDR, we created three datasets, by characterizing each one-minute measurement with a corresponding sky condition.
The all-sky conditions, containing all the valid measurements.
The clear-sky conditions data, correspond to data where we have inferred that the sky was almost clear of clouds, and the remainder part the data was characterized with cloud sky conditions (cloud-sky).
To identify the clear-sky conditions we used the method proposed by C. N. Long and Ackerman (2000) and by Reno and Hansen (2016), that was adapted and configured for the site.

\ldots.

\ldots\ldots{}

We have to note, that the definition of what constitutes as clear or cloudy sky, has some subjectivity, due to the used method of characterization.
As a result, the details of the definition are site specific, it relies on a combination of threshold of comparisons with ideal actinometric models and statistics on different signal behavior.

The algorithm was calibrated with the main focus to identify the presence of clouds on the sky dome, although there are marginal cases that there will be false positives or false negatives identifications.

As global radiation clear sky reference we are using the Haurwitz's model, adjusted for our site with a factor of 0.965 (Eq. \ref{eq:ahau}).
The selection of a clear sky reference model, was based on SDR observation from the period 2016 -- 2021.
Where, after an iterative optimization of eight simple models (Daneshyar--Paltridge--Proctor, Kasten--Czeplak, Haurwitz, Berger--Duffie, Adnot--Bourges--Campana--Gicquel, Robledo-Soler, Kasten and Ineichen-Perez) with different factors.
We found, that Haurwitz's model, adjusted with a factor of 0.965 has the lower root mean squared error (RMSE).
The tried models are described by Reno, Hansen, and Stein (2012b) and tested by Reno and Hansen (2016).
The iterative optimization method, for the selection of the reference is discussed by C. N. Long and Ackerman (2000) and Reno and Hansen (2016).

\begin{equation}
\text{SDR}_\text{Clear Sky} = 0.965 \times 1098 \times \cos( \text{SZA} ) \times \exp \left( \frac{ - 0.057}{\cos(\text{SZA})} \right) \label{eq:ahau}
\end{equation}

The following criteria and thresholds were used to identify clear-sky conditions.
Each criterion was applied for a running window of \(11\) consecutive measurements/minutes, and the characterization is applied at the center value of the window.
A data point is consider as under cloud-sky condition if it fails to pass any of the criteria, all the other data points are characterized as clear-sky.

The mean of the measured value \(\overline{G}_i\) must be inside an envelope based on the reference model \(\text{SDR}_\text{Clear Sky}\) (Eq. \ref{eq:MeanVIP}).

\begin{equation}
0.91 \times \overline{\text{SDR}}_{i\text{Clear Sky}} - 20
< \overline{G}_i <
1.095 \times \overline{\text{SDR}}_{i\text{Clear Sky}} + 30
\label{eq:MeanVIP}
\end{equation}

The running max measured value \(M_{Gi} = max[\text{SDR}_{i}]\), is compared to a similar constructed value from the reference \(M_{CSi} = max[\text{SDR}_{i\text{Clear Sky}}]\) (Eq. \ref{eq:MaxVIP}).

\begin{equation}
1 \times M_{CSi} - 75
< M_{Gi} <
1 \times M_{CSi} + 75
\label{eq:MaxVIP}
\end{equation}

The length \(L\) (Eq. \ref{eq:VILeq}) of the sequence of line segments connecting the points of the SDR time
series for the measured values \(L\) and similar for the reference \(L_{CS}\), must be within the limits of Eq. \ref{eq:VILcr}.

\begin{equation}
L = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\sqrt{\left ( \text{SDR}_{i+1} - \text{SDR}_{i}\right )^2 + \left ( t_{i+1} - t_i \right )^2}
\label{eq:VILeq}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
1 \times L_{CSi} - 5 < L_i < 1.3 \times L_{CSi} + 13
\label{eq:VILcr}
\end{equation}

We calculate the standard deviation \(\sigma\) of the slope
(\(s\)) between sequential points in the time series, normalized by the average SDR during the time interval.

\begin{equation}
s_i = \frac{\text{SDR}_{i+1} - \text{SDR}_{i}}{t_{i+1} - t_i}, \forall i \in \left \{ 1, 2, \ldots, n-1 \right \},\;\;
\bar{s} = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} s_i,\;\;
\sigma_i = \frac {\sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \left( s_i - \bar{s} \right)^2} } {\bar{G_i}} \label{eq:VCT3b}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\sigma_i < \ensuremath{1.1\times 10^{-4}}
\label{eq:VCTcr}
\end{equation}

The maximum difference \(X\) between the change in measured irradiance and the change in clear sky
irradiance over each measurement interval.

\begin{gather}
x_i = \text{SDR}_{i+1} - \text{SDR}_{i} \forall i \in \left \{ 1, 2, \ldots, n-1 \right \} \label{eq:VSM1} \\
x_{CS,i} = \text{SDR}_{CS,i+1} - \text{SDR}_{CS,i} \forall i \in \left \{ 1, 2, \ldots, n-1 \right \} \label{eq:VSM2} \\
X_i = \max{\left \{ \left | x_i - x_{CS,i} \right | \right \}} \label{eq:VSM3}
\end{gather}

\begin{equation}
X_i < 7.5
\label{eq:VSMcr}
\end{equation}

Due to a significant measurement uncertainty near, the horizon, we have to exclude
all measurements with SZA greater than \(85^\circ\).
Moreover, due to some obstructions around the site (hills and buildings), we excluded data with Azimuth angle between
\(35^\circ\) and \(120^\circ\) with SZA greater than \(80^\circ\).
On the latter instances, Sun is systematically, not visible by the instrument's location.
To make the measurements comparable throughout the dataset, we adjusted all 1-minute radiometric values to the mean Sun - Earth distance.
Subsequently, we made all measurements relative to the Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) at \(1 \text{au}\), in order to compensate for the Sun's intensity variability, using a homogenized time series of satellite TSI observations.
The TSI data we use, comes from NOAA (Coddington et al. 2005), it overlaps with our data, and is interpolated to match with the time step of the data.
As a result, we can present all radiation data as a fraction of Sun's TSI.

\hypertarget{aggregation-of-radiometric-data}{%
\subsubsection{Aggregation of radiometric data}\label{aggregation-of-radiometric-data}}

Before further analysis and deseasonalization, we implement an appropriate aggregation scheme on the 1-minute data. To preserve the representativeness we use the following criteria:
a) for daily mean values we exclude instances with less than 180 valid data points,
b) accordingly, monthly values are computed by daily aggregated data, where months with less than 20 days are rejected.
The daily seasonal values were indexed based on the day of year number, and the monthly by the corresponding calendar month.
For the seasons of the year trends, we grouped the mean daily values by season (December - February: Winter, March - May: Spring, etc.).
Finally, for each data set, we remove the natural occurring seasonal variation.
This is done, by calculating the mean values for the appropriate time step, and subtracting the annual cycle from the actual data.
In addition to the previous aggregation scheme, each dataset was aggregate in \(1^\circ\) SZA bins, separate for cases before and after local noon.
This gave us an approximation of Sun's SZA contribution to the SDR brightening.

Thus, for each data set we have obtained the relative departure of the seasonal mean.
The statistical significance and aggregation scheme and filtering will be noted along with the corresponding results.
