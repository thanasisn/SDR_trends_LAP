# Representation?

Filter just all-sky 
and assume cloud and clear no need filtering?


# Cloud “shrinking” and “optical thinning” in the “dimming” period and a subsequent recovery in the “brightening” period over China

Analysis 
- relies only on CF!
- clear-sky indices
- SWCRE shortwave radiative effect of clouds
