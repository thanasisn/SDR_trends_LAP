Comments and Suggestions for Authors

This study evaluates the trends of downward solar irradiance (SDR) in
Thessaloniki (Greece) using 30 years of data. It is a very interesting
work although the conclusions are limited because there is no available
data for aerosols and clouds for this long period, although the authors
could use a database, even if it is shorter in time, to corroborate
hypotheses raised in this work. However, this paper can be published
after addressing my following comments.


Major comments:


1.      To study the trends of SDR in Thessaloniki and to explain these
trends, the authors use three types of sky conditions. Thus, the
authors mention two methods to distinguish between different sky
conditions, the method of Long and Ackerman and the method of Renon
(lines 85-87). Finally, what is the method followed by authors? It‚Äôs
worthy to note that the first method uses diffuse irradiance
measurements to identify clear periods. Are these measurements
available for this database?


2.      The authors use the Haurwitz model to estimate clear sky, but
the coefficient used is 0.057 instead of 0.059. The expression used by
Long and Ackerman (2000) is simpler ( [clip_image002.gif]  )(Œ∏: solar
zenith angle) with the fitting parameters found by the site.

I think that a simple expression is better adapted to the physical
mean, besides the relationship between SDR or irradiance for other
wavelengths ranges and the cosine of Œ∏ is this exponential form for
clear skies. It is possible to parameterise only the envelope of the
data of SDR for all sky conditions through a simple linear dependence
on the cosine of ùúÉ, this envelope of the data corresponds to the
maximum values that can be assumed to values corresponding to clear
skies (for example Foyo-Moreno et al., 2017 used this method). With
this method the authors could use an own functional equation fitted
from their data.

3.      This work analyses the trends for three sky types (all-sky,
clear and cloudy conditions).  Many authors use the clearness index
(k[t]) to separate clear and cloudy skies. It should be interesting an
evaluation of the trends of SDR for clear skies, intermediate skies and
cloudy skies considering this index. Perhaps the results are different
to that found because this index considers the atmosphere transparency.
Besides, this classification would allow greater distinction to be made
among sky types.


4.      The authors analyse the trends of SDR through the anomalies,
what is the mean climatological value for the whole period? On the
other hand, the authors also could directly study the values of SDR.
This allows for estimating the slope with values of Wm^-2 and to
compare with other works. Pyrina et al. (2015) evaluate the cloud
effects on SDR of the Mediterranean basin, and they found that the
presence of clouds results in a cooling, by up to about 60 or 70 Wm^‚àí2,
for warm seasons whereas for cold seasons the cooling is reduced to the
half.

5.      The authors should provide a possible explanation of the
complex evolution of the anomalies mentioned in line 187. What
parameters can affect the anomalies pattern? How is the pattern
followed by the main meteorological parameters as temperature, relative
humidity and precipitation for the studied period? A clarification of
the diurnal climatology and changes of the relevant meteorological
parameters is of high importance to understand the diurnal
variabilities of SDR and aerosols and their complicated interactions.
In fact, other factor very important (besides aerosols) is water vapour
content for clear skies (Yu et al., 2022).

6.      The pattern followed for all-sky and clear conditions is very
similar, logic result taking into account the high frequency of clear
sky cases. From figure 2 showing the cumulative sum plots, for the
three types of skies, there is a trend change in 2005. It should be
interesting to analyse the period before and after in more detail.
However, the relatively stable period found from 2005 to 2015 is not
found for cloudy skies. Why? Besides, for all years the sign of CUSUM
of anomalies is negative for clear skies, with values above 400% for
the stable period between 2005 and 2015, and for cloudy skies is
positive, practically for all years, with values above 500% precisely
during the year 2005. A more detailed discussion is necessary.


7.      In figure 3 the authors show the cumulative sum plots of
monthly SDR anomalies, and they attributed the positive CUSUMs for
cloudy skies to the likely decrease of the cloud optical thickness, but
what are they based on? To ensure the clouds effect on SDR it is
necessary to have some cloud information. This information can be
obtained, for example, from the European Centre for Medium-range
Weather Forecast (ECMWF) Reanalysis Fifth Generation (ERA5) database.
Besides, this result can be also attributed to a minor presence of
aerosols or aerosols with different properties.


8.      From figure 3 there is a change of sign in 2008 for cloudy
skies. The interpretation or possible explanation is not given in the
text.


9.      Considering effects of Œ∏ on SDR, the authors found a positive
trend increasing Œ∏ for clear and all-sky conditions. This result is
also found by Wang et al. (2020) using data of SDR for a period of 22
years over 96 sites in China. Anyway, a possible explanation should be
added.

10.  In the analysis by seasons (section 3.3), the seasonal differences
are attributed to the decrease in cloud optical thickness (line 233),
but this result can be also explained by the different aerosol types
present in the atmosphere depending on the season or the combination of
both factors. Despite the complex causes for global dimming and
brightening, anthropogenic aerosols have been increasingly proposed as
the dominant factor regulating the decadal trends (Wang et al., 2020).
In fact, the lowest values found for aerosol optical depth are found in
winter over the Mediterranean region with less frequency of dust events
(Lozano et al. 2021, Gkikas et al., 2018). Another parameter affecting
is the planetary boundary layer (PBL). Precisely the decrease of the
total AOD seems to occur mainly in the lower atmospheric layers
(Fountoulakis et al., 2016). Furthermore, the decreasing trend observed
for AOD in Thessaloniki is mainly attributed to changes in the aerosol
properties inside the boundary layer (Siomos et al., 2018),

https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-11885-2018



11.  The cloud effects on SDR are very complex due to more complex
interactions depending not only on cloud cover but also on cloud
characteristics, varying for different seasons. A recent work of Lozano
et al. (2023), using data during 11 years at a mid-latitude urban site
in the Mediterranean basin found that clouds are exerting less cooling
effects in this Mediterranean site over time with a value of 1.22 Wm^-2
year^-1. Thus, recent references could be added.
