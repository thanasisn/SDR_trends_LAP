Comments and Suggestions for Authors

The paper “Trends from 30-year observations of downward solar
irradiance in Thessaloniki, Greece” is an interesting analysis of the
SDR in Greece for the last 30 years. The practical applications could
range from biology to the production of electrical energy by solar
panels. In fact, solar irradiance seems to be getting more and more
attention in the relevant climate literature, and the paper fits in
with this. In particular, one is interested in the trends of SDR as a
function of sky conditions, seasons and years, which is thoroughly
discussed in the paper.

However, revisions are needed in the tables, figures and accompanying
text. The authors should inform the reader which test method was used
(most likely the t-test). Also, the statistical significance should be
only expressed in p-values, as is already done correctly in the caption
of Figure 4 and Figure A3.

After these minor revisions, the major ones follow: With more than
10000 data points, it is quite normal for the statistical significance
of a linear regression to be close to p = 0. As the number of data
points increases, so does the significance, because the statistical
test becomes more sensitive. This effect has two serious pitfalls. The
significance of too many data points is worthless or may even be false.
Worthless because high significance is very different from a large
effect. False because the statistical independence of the regression
errors is often autocorrelated (if the data points are close in time,
it is likely that the data points are not statistically independent).
This would mean that the t-test is wrong because the t-test requires
statistical independence of the regression errors.

Much better than the difficult task of assessing the regression errors
is to leave the statistical significance in many tables and figures of
the paper. I recommend this. The authors should instead report
Pearson's r and R = r^2 as the dimension of the effect. R gives the
true effect of the linear regression, which is likely to be very small
in Figure 1, Figure A1 and Figure A2.

This means that the trend and statistical significance in Table 1 and
Table 2 should be replaced by r and R = r^2. In Figure 1, Figure A1 and
Figure A2 the trend should also be removed and replaced by r and R. The
text of the paper and also the abstract must be adapted to the above
corrections.
