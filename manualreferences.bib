  abstract         = {The variability of shortwave downward solar irradiance (SDR) received at Earthś surface over Thessaloniki, Greece for the period 1993-2011 is investigated, focusing on the effects from the aerosols variability on the irradiance trends derived for different solar zenith angles (SZA). Linear trends have been calculated for the entire dataset, for cloud-free cases, and for different SZAs, separately for each season. The global upward trend in SDR after 1990 (0.33%year-1) is reconfirmed and is found to depend strongly on SZA, ranging from ∼0.1 to +0.6%year-1. The long term changes in aerosols in conjunction with the local aerosol patterns result in differences of up to 0.1%year-1 in the derived trends in SDR between morning and afternoon hours. Finally, based on the analysis of the cumulative sums of the differences in monthly averages of SDR from the long term mean we report signs of a slowdown in the upward trend in SDR during the beginning of the 2000s. textcopyright2012 Royal Meteorological Society.},

  abstract         = {There is increasing evidence that the amount of solar radiation incident at the Earthś surface is not stable over the years but undergoes significant decadal variations. Here I review the evidence for these changes, their magnitude, their possible causes, their representation in climate models, and their potential implications for climate change. The various studies analyzing long-term records of surface radiation measurements suggest a widespread decrease in surface solar radiation between the 1950s and 1980s ("global dimming"), with a partial recovery more recently at many locations ("brightening"). There are also some indications for an "early brightening" in the first part of the 20\textsuperscript{th} century. These variations are in line with independent long-term observations of sunshine duration, diurnal temperature range, pan evaporation, and, more recently, satellite-derived estimates, which add credibility to the existence of these changes and their larger-scale significance. Current climate models, in general, tend to simulate these decadal variations to a much lesser degree. The origins of these variations are internal to the Earthś atmosphere and not externally forced by the Sun. Variations are not only found under cloudy but also under cloud-free atmospheres, indicative of an anthropogenic contribution through changes in aerosol emissions governed by economic developments and air pollution regulations. The relative importance of aerosols, clouds, and aerosol-cloud interactions may differ depending on region and pollution level. Highlighted are further potential implications of dimming and brightening for climate change, which may affect global warming, the components and intensity of the hydrological cycle, the carbon cycle, and the cryosphere among other climate elements.

  abstract         = {The increasing severity of droughts/ﬂoods and worsening air quality from increasing aerosols in Asia monsoon regions are the two gravest threats facing over 60\% of the world population living in Asian monsoon regions. These dual threats have fueled a large body of research in the last decade on the roles of aerosols in impacting Asian monsoon weather and climate. This paper provides a comprehensive review of studies on Asian aerosols, monsoons, and their interactions. The Asian monsoon region is a primary source of emissions of diverse species of aerosols from both anthropogenic and natural origins. The distributions of aerosol loading are strongly inﬂuenced by distinct weather and climatic regimes, which are, in turn, modulated by aerosol effects. On a continental scale, aerosols reduce surface insolation and weaken the land-ocean thermal contrast, thus inhibiting the development of monsoons. Locally, aerosol radiative effects alter the thermodynamic stability and convective potential of the lower atmosphere leading to reduced temperatures, increased atmospheric stability, and weakened wind and atmospheric circulations. The atmospheric thermodynamic state, which determines the formation of clouds, convection, and precipitation, may also be altered by aerosols serving as cloud condensation nuclei or ice nuclei. Absorbing aerosols such as black carbon and desert dust in Asian monsoon regions may also induce dynamical feedback processes, leading to a strengthening of the early monsoon and affecting the subsequent evolution of the monsoon. Many mechanisms have been put forth regarding how aerosols modulate the amplitude, frequency, intensity, and phase of different monsoon climate variables. A wide range of theoretical, observational, and modeling ﬁndings on the Asian monsoon, aerosols, and their interactions are synthesized. A new paradigm is proposed on investigating aerosol-monsoon interactions, in which natural aerosols such as desert dust, black carbon from biomass burning, and biogenic aerosols from vegetation are considered integral components of an intrinsic aerosol-monsoon climate system, subject to external forcing of global warming, anthropogenic aerosols, and land use and change. Future research on aerosol-monsoon interactions calls for an integrated approach and international collaborations based on long-term sustained observations, process measurements, and improved models, as well as using observations to constrain model simulations and projections.},

The clear-sky detection method is verified using Whole Sky Imager and lidar data, observer reports, and model comparisons. Identified clear-sky irradiance measurements are then used to empirically fit clear-sky irradiance functions using the cosine of the solar zenith angle as the independent variable. These fitted functions produce continuous estimates of clear-sky total, diffuse, and direct component shortwave irradiances. While this method ignores diurnal changes in such variables as column water vapor and aerosol amounts and changes between clear-sky days, it is shown that the resultant clear-sky irradiance estimates have RMS uncertainty comparable to the uncertainty of the measuring instruments themselves. The estimated clear-sky irradiances are used to estimate the effect of clouds on the downwelling shortwave irradiance as a difference between the measured and clear-sky amounts. We show that the cloud effect calculations from this method appear to decrease the uncertainty due to systematic pyranometer offsets and cosine response errors. Thus any data set that includes downwelling diffuse and total shortwave measurements can be processed to identify clear-sky periods and produce estimates of clear-sky irradiance and cloud effects.},

Concurrently, emissions of anthropogenic aerosols will decline, due to coemission with {GHG}, and measures to improve air quality. However, the combined climate effect of {GHG} and aerosol emissions over the industrial era is poorly constrained. Here we show the climate impacts from removing present-day anthropogenic aerosol emissions and compare them to the impacts from moderate {GHG}-dominated global warming. Removing aerosols induces a global mean surface heating of 0.5–1.1°C, and precipitation increase of 2.0–4.6\%. Extreme weather indices also increase. We ﬁnd a higher sensitivity of extreme events to aerosol reductions, per degree of surface warming, in particular over the major aerosol emission regions. Under near-term warming, we ﬁnd that regional climate change will depend strongly on the balance between aerosol and {GHG} forcing. Plain Language Summary To keep within 1.5 or 2° of global warming, we need massive reductions of greenhouse gas emissions. At the same time, aerosol emissions will be strongly reduced. We show how cleaning up aerosols, predominantly sulfate, may add an additional half a degree of global warming, with impacts that strengthen those from greenhouse gas warming. The northern hemisphere is found to be more sensitive to aerosol removal than greenhouse gas warming, because of where the aerosols are emitted today. This means that it does not only matter whether or not we reach international climate targets. It also matters how we get there.},

  abstract         = {The amount of solar (shortwave) radiation that reaches the Earth’s surface underwent substantial variations over recent decades. Since the 1950s, surface shortwave radiation gradually decreased at widespread locations. In Europe, this so-called surface dimming continued until the late 1980s, when surface brightening set in and surface shortwave radiation increased again. In China, the dimming levelled off in the 1980s, but did not turn into brightening until 2005. Changes in clouds and aerosol are the prime potential causes for the phenomenon, but the scientific community has not yet reached a consensus about the relative role of the different potential forcing agents. Here we bring together co-located long-term observational data from surface and space to study decadal changes of the shortwave energy balance in Europe and China from 1985 to 2015. Within this observation-based framework, we show that an increasing net shortwave radiation at the top of the atmosphere and a decreasing atmospheric shortwave absorption each contribute roughly half of the observed brightening trends in Europe. For China, we find that the continued dimming until 2005 and the subsequent brightening occurred despite opposing trends in the top-of-the-atmosphere net shortwave radiation. This shows that changes in atmospheric shortwave absorption are a major driver of European brightening and the dominant cause for the Chinese surface trends. Although the observed variations cannot be attributed unambiguously, we discuss potential causes for the observed changes.},

Here, we investigate this issue using daily data from the prominent long-term observational radiation record at Potsdam, Germany, over the 71-year period 1947–2017. We identify cloud-free days based on synop cloud observations as well as on days with maximum atmospheric transmission. Irrespective of the cloud-screening method, strong dimming and brightening tendencies in the atmospheric transmission are evident not only under all-sky but also of similar magnitude under clear-sky conditions, causing multidecadal variations in surface solar radiation on the order of 10 Wm−2. This points to the cloud-free atmosphere as a main responsible for dimming and brightening in central Europe and suggests that these variations are anthropogenically forced rather than of natural origin, with aerosol pollutants as likely major drivers.},

Aerosol properties derived from Sun photometer measurements and aerosol-induced changes in downwelling shortwave surface irradiances are analyzed in this paper. It is shown that the mean aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 500 nm is 0.63. The day-to-day variation of aerosol optical depth is dramatic, with a maximum daily AOD close to 2.0 and a minimum value close to the background level. Dust activities generally produce heavy aerosol loading characterized by larger particle sizes and less absorption than those observed under normal conditions. The reduction of instantaneous direct shortwave surface irradiance per unit of AOD is 404.5 W M<sup>-2</sup>. About 63.8% of this reduction is offset by an increase in diffuse irradiance; consequently, one unit increase in AOD leads to a decrease in global surface irradiance of 146.3 W m<sup>-2</sup>. The diurnal aerosol direct radiative forcing efficiency is about -47.4 W m<sup>-2</sup>. Overall, aerosols reduce about 30 W m<sup>-2</sup> per day of surface net shortwave irradiance in this suburban region. Copyright 2007 by the American Geophysical Union.},

irradiation, sunshine duration, diurnal temperature range and the fraction
of the sky covered by clouds in the city of São Paulo, Brazil, were
analysed. The main purpose was to contribute to the characterization and
understanding of the dimming and brightening effects on solar global
radiation in this part of South America. As observed in most of the previous
studies worldwide, in this study, during the period between 1961 and the early
1980s, a negative trend in surface solar irradiation was detected in
São Paulo, characterizing the occurrence of a dimming effect. Sunshine
duration and the diurnal temperature range also presented negative trends,
in opposition to the positive trend observed in the cloud cover fraction.
However, a brightening effect, as observed in western industrialized
countries in more recent years, was not observed. Instead, for surface
downward irradiation, the negative trend persisted, with a trend of −0.13 {MJ} m−2 per decade, with a p value of 0.006, for the 56 years of data and
in consonance with the cloud cover fraction increasing trend, but not
statistically significant, of 0.3 \% per decade (p value = 0.198). The
trends for sunshine duration and the diurnal temperature range, by contrast,
changed signal, as confirmed by a piecewise linear regression model. Some
possible causes for the discrepancy are discussed, such as the frequency of
fog occurrence, urban heat island effects, horizontal visibility (as a proxy
for aerosol loading variability) and greenhouse gas concentration increase.
Future studies on the aerosol effect are planned, particularly with higher
temporal resolution, as well as modelling studies, to better analyse the
contribution of each possible cause.},

  abstract         = {Downward surface solar radiation ({SSR}) is a crucial component of the global energy balance, affecting temperature and the hydrological cycle profoundly, and it provides crucial information about climate change. Many studies have examined {SSR} trends; however, they have often concentrated on speciﬁc regions due to limited spatial coverage of ground-based observation stations. To overcome this spatial limitation, this study performs a spatial interpolation based on a machine learning method, random forest, to interpolate monthly {SSR} anomalies using a number of climatic variables (various temperature indices, cloud coverage, etc.), time-point indicators (years and months of {SSR} observations), and geographical characteristics of locations (latitude, longitude, etc.). The predictors that provide the largest explanatory power for interannual variability are diurnal temperature range and cloud coverage. The output of the spatial interpolation is a 0.58 3 0.58 monthly gridded dataset of {SSR} anomalies with complete land coverage over the period 1961–2019, which is used afterward in a comprehensive trend analysis for (i) each continent separately and (ii) the entire globe. The continental-level analysis reveals the major contributors to the global dimming and brightening. In particular, the global dimming before the 1980s is primarily dominated by negative trends in Asia and North America, whereas Europe and Oceania have been the two largest contributors to the brightening after 1982 and up until 2019.},

In contrast, over Beijing, China, where air quality measures were taken later, solar brightening was delayed. It is shown that until the early 1990s, {UV}-A irradiances over Thessaloniki show a downward trend of –0.5\% yr−1, which reverses sign and becomes positive in the last decade (+0.8\% yr−1). This brightening is related to a decreasing trend in local aerosol amounts. Both the negative rate of change (dimming) and the positive rate of change (brightening) are ampliﬁed in the {UV}-A solar irradiances, compared with the total solar irradiance, by a factor of 2.6. Satellite derived short-wave radiation over Beijing showed negative changes of –0.4\% (1984–1991) and –0.1\% yr−1 during 1994–2006. The negative trend in solar radiation continued even during 2000–2006. Satellite-derived aerosol optical depth ({AOD}) increased by +1.0\% yr−1 during 2000–2006, in agreement with in situ measurements of increasing {AOD}. Therefore, a statistically signiﬁcant change from dimming to brightening in Beijing could not be seen in the last decade, but it is expected to occur in the near future.},

This report provides an overview of a number of global horizontal irradiance (GHI) clear sky models from very simple to complex. Validation of clear-sky models requires comparison of model results to measured irradiance during clear-sky periods. To facilitate validation, we present a new algorithm for automatically identifying clear-sky periods in a time series of GHI measurements. We evaluate the performance of selected clear-sky models using measured data from 30 different sites, totaling about 300 site-years of data. We analyze the variation of these errors across time and location. In terms of error averaged over all locations and times, we found that complex models that correctly account for all the atmospheric parameters are slightly more accurate than other models, but, primarily at low elevations, comparable accuracy can be obtained from some simpler models. However, simpler models often exhibit errors that vary with time of day and season, whereas the errors for complex models vary less over time.},

  abstract         = {Clear sky models estimate the terrestrial solar radiation under a cloudless sky as a function of the solar elevation angle, site altitude, aerosol concentration, water vapor, and various atmospheric conditions. This report provides an overview of a number of global horizontal irradiance (GHI) clear sky models from very simple to complex. Validation of clear-sky models requires comparison of model results to measured irradiance during clear-sky periods. To facilitate validation, we present a new algorithm for automatically identifying clear-sky periods in a time series of GHI measurements. We evaluate the performance of selected clear-sky models using measured data from 30 different sites, totaling about 300 site-years of data. We analyze the variation of these errors across time and location. In terms of error averaged over all locations and times, we found that complex models that correctly account for all the atmospheric parameters are slightly more accurate than other models, but, primarily at low elevations, comparable accuracy can be obtained from some simpler models. However, simpler models often exhibit errors that vary with time of day and season, whereas the errors for complex models vary less over time.},

  abstract         = {In this study, we present an aerosol classification technique based on measurements of a double monochromator Brewer spectrophotometer during the period 1998-2017 in Thessaloniki, Greece. A machine learning clustering procedure was applied based on the Mahalanobis distance metric. The classification process utilizes the UV Single Scattering Albedo (SSA) at 340 nm and the Extinction Angstrom Exponent (EAE) at 320-360 nm that are obtained from the spectrophotometer. The analysis is supported by measurements from a CIMEL sunphotometer that were deployed in order to establish the training dataset of Brewer measurements. By applying the Mahalanobis distance algorithm to the Brewer timeseries, we automatically assigned measurements in one of the following clusters: Fine Non Absorbing Mixtures (FNA): 64.7%, Black Carbon Mixtures (BC): 17.4%, Dust Mixtures (DUST): 8.1%, and Mixed: 9.8%. We examined the clustering potential of the algorithm by reclassifying the training dataset and comparing it with the original one and also by using manually classified cases. The typing score of the Mahalanobis algorithm is high for all predominant clusters FNA: 77.0%, BC: 63.9%, and DUST: 80.3% when compared with the training dataset. We obtained high scores as well FNA: 100.0%, BC: 66.7%, and DUST: 83.3% when comparing it with the manually classified dataset. The flags obtained here were applied in the timeseries of the Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) at 340 nm of the Brewer and the CIMEL in order to compare between the two and also stress the future impact of the proposed clustering technique in climatological studies of the station.},

It also considers statistical issues that arise in assessing the significance of individual trends and of trend differences between data sets. Possible causes of these trends are not addressed. We use data from satellite and radiosonde measurements and from two reanalysis projects. To facilitate intercomparison, we compute from reanalyses and radiosonde data temperatures equivalent to those from the satellite‐based Microwave Sounding Unit ({MSU}). We compare linear trends based on minimization of absolute deviations ({LA}) and minimization of squared deviations ({LS}). Differences are generally less than 0.05°C/decade over 1959–1996. Over 1979–1993, they exceed 0.10°C/decade for lower tropospheric time series and 0.15°C/decade for the lower stratosphere. Trend fitting by the {LA} method can degrade the lower‐tropospheric trend agreement of 0.03°C/decade (over 1979–1996) previously reported for the {MSU} and radiosonde data. In assessing trend significance we employ two methods to account for temporal autocorrelation effects. With our preferred method, virtually none of the individual 1979–1993 trends in deep‐layer temperatures are significantly different from zero. To examine trend differences between data sets we compute 95\% confidence intervals for individual trends and show that these overlap for almost all data sets considered. Confidence intervals for lower‐tropospheric trends encompass both zero and the model‐projected trends due to anthropogenic effects. We also test the significance of a trend in
              d
              (
              t

              (
              t
              ) removes variability common to both time series and facilitates identification of small trend differences. This more discerning test reveals that roughly 30\% of the data set comparisons have significant differences in lower‐tropospheric trends, primarily related to differences in measurement system. Our study gives empirical estimates of statistical uncertainties in recent atmospheric temperature trends. These estimates and the simple significance testing framework used here facilitate the interpretation of previous temperature trend comparisons involving satellite, radiosonde, and reanalysis data sets.},

During the previous works a detailed characterization of the photosynthetically active radiation ({PAR}; 400–700 nm), as well as analysis the aerosol and clouds effects on {PAR} was carried out. This research work addresses an analysis of solar radiation on the total solar irradiance spectrum ({TSI}; 280–3000 nm) in terms of the effects of different atmospheric conditions on it, considered by the clearness index and the cloud cover, bringing very valuable findings from the long-term comparative analysis of radiative effects of clouds on {TSI} and {PAR} wavelength ranges. The average values in the entire period of the study for the global solar radiation in the total solar irradiance ({TSIGlobal}) found to be 450 ± 100 Wm− 2 and 530 ± 110 Wm− 2 under all and clearsky conditions, respectively. Meanwhile, the average values for the diffuse component ({TSIDiffuse}) are 141 ± 21 Wm− 2 and 130 ± 21 Wm− 2 (all and clear skies, respectively), with a relatively low interannual variation up to 11\% for both global and diffuse {TSI}, as well as for both sky conditions. Analysis on the total cloud cover ({TCC}) shows that the clearness index is not a good parameter to discriminate between all and clear sky conditions, since there is a marked overlap in the ranges of the kt values for the different categories of {TCC}. Additionally, the cloud radiative forcing ({CRF}) are computed as the difference in solar radiation measured under all and clear sky conditions. A high seasonal variability is found for {CRF}, where {CRFTSI},Global ranges between − 37.6 Wm− 2 and -137.4 Wm− 2, while {CRFTSI},Diffuse from 4.4 Wm− 2 to 22.6 Wm− 2. The positive sign implies increase in solar radiation at the surface, while the negative one implies the opposite, i.e., less availability of solar radiation on the surface. Finally, the analysis of the annual evolution of {CRF} reveals a downward trend on {CRFTSI} and {CRFPAR}, for both global and diffuse This relevant finding implies that clouds are exerting less cooling effects over time at this Mediterranean site.},

  abstract         = {<p>Brewer spectrophotometers are widely used instruments which perform spectral measurements of the direct and the global solar UV irradiance. By processing these measurements a variety of secondary products can be derived such as the total columns of ozone, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide, and aerosol optical properties. Estimating and limiting the uncertainties of the final products is of critical importance. High quality data have a lot of applications and can provide accurate estimations of trends. The dead time is characteristic for each instrument and non-proper correction of the raw data for its effect may lead to important errors in the final products. It may change with time and the currently used methodology is not always sufficient to accurately determine the correct dead time. For specific cases, such as for low ozone slant columns and high intensities of the direct solar irradiance, the error in the retrieved TOC, due a 10 ns change in the dead time from its nominal value, is found to be up to 5 %. The error in the calculation of UV irradiance is about 3â•ﬁ4 % near the maximum operational limit of light intensities. While in the existing documentation it is indicated that the dead time effects are important when the error in the used value is greater than 2 ns, we found that for single monochromator Brewers a 2 ns error in the dead time may lead to uncertainties above the limit of 1 % in the calculation of TOC; thus the tolerance limit should be lowered. A new routine for the determination of the dead time from direct solar irradiance measurements has been created and tested and a validation of the operational algorithm has been performed. Additionally, new methods for the estimation and the validation of the dead time have been developed and are analytically described. Therefore, the present study in addition to highlighting the importance of the dead time for the processing of Brewer datasets, also provide useful information for their quality control and re-evaluation.</p>},

For this purpose, measurements of two independent instruments, a lidar and a sunphotometer, were used. These two instruments represent two individual networks, the European Lidar Aerosol Network ({EARLINET}) and the Aerosol Robotic Network ({AERONET}). They include different measurement schedules. Fourteen years of lidar and sunphotometer measurements were analyzed, independently of each other, in order to obtain the annual cycles and trends of various optical and geometrical aerosol properties in the boundary layer, in the free troposphere, and for the whole atmospheric column. The analysis resulted in consistent statistically significant and decreasing trends of aerosol optical depth ({AOD}) at 355 nm of −23.2 and −22.3 \% per decade in the study period over Thessaloniki for the {EARLINET} and the {AERONET} datasets, respectively. Therefore, the analysis indicates that the {EARLINET} sampling schedule can be quite effective in producing data that can be applied to long-term climatological studies. It is also shown that the observed decreasing trend is mainly attributed to changes in the aerosol load inside the boundary layer. Seasonal profiles of the most dominant aerosol mixture types observed over Thessaloniki have been generated from the lidar data. The higher values of the vertically resolved extinction coefficient at 355 nm appear in summer, while the lower ones appear in winter. The dust component is more dominant in the free troposphere than in the boundary layer during summer. The biomass burning layers tend to arrive in the free troposphere during spring and summer. This kind of information can be quite useful for applications that require a priori aerosol profiles. For instance, they can be utilized in models that require aerosol climatological data as input, in the development of algorithms for satellite products, and also in passive remote-sensing techniques that require knowledge of the aerosol vertical distribution.},

This result points out the relevance of the aerosol effects on the {PAR} range, which can involve up to a 50\% of the Total {ARF}. Moreover, a notable dependence of {ARF} and {AFE} on the solar position has been detected, increasing their absolute values at solar zenith angle from 0o to 45o-60o and decreasing to zero for lower solar positions. Additionally, this analysis has revealed the existence of a significant downward trend in {AFE} values for {PAR}, with a slope of 2.7 Wm− 2τ− 1 year− 1. Although the slope is positive, taking into account that the {AFE} values are negative, the slope value implies that the aerosol cooling radiative effect of aerosols is decreasing. However, no trends have been detected neither in {AFE} nor {ARF} values in the Total solar range. These results evidence the long-term aerosol effects over the different spectral intervals and emphasize the need for detailed analysis of the aerosol radiative effects on fundamental spectral intervals such as the {PAR} range.},
