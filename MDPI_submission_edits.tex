\DIFaddend 

The shortwave downward solar irradiance (SDR) at Earth's surface plays a
significant role \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, }\DIFdelend on its climate. Changes \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{of }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{in }\DIFaddend the SDR can be related to
changes \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{on }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{in }\DIFaddend Earth's energy budget, the mechanisms of climate change, and
water and carbon cycles \citep{Wild2009}. It can also affect solar and
agricultural production \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, }\DIFdelend and all living organisms. Studies of SDR
variability \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, }\DIFdelend have identified some distinct SDR trends \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{on }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{in }\DIFaddend different
regions of the world \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{on }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{in }\DIFaddend different time periods. The term `brightening'
is generally used to describe periods of positive SDR trend, and
`dimming' for \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{periods of }\DIFaddend negative trend \citep{Wild2009}. There are many
cases in the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{long term }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{long-term }\DIFaddend records of irradiance \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, }\DIFdelend showing a systematic change
in the magnitude of the trend, occurring roughly in the last decades of
the 20th century. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{On }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{At }\DIFaddend multiple stations in China, a dimming period was
reported until about 2000, followed by a brightening period
\citep{Yang2021}. A similar pattern was identified, with \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{a }\DIFaddend breaking
point around 1980, for stations in Central Europe \citep{Wild2021} and
Brazil \citep{Yamasoe2021}. On global scale, an artificial \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Intelligence
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{intelligence
}\DIFaddend aided spatial analysis on \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the }\DIFaddend continental level with data from multiple
stations \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{reach }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{reached }\DIFaddend similar conclusions for these regions and for the
global trend \citep{Yuan2021}.

There is a consensus among researchers that the major factor affecting
the variability of SDR attenuation is the interactions of solar
radiation with atmospheric aerosols and clouds. Those interactions,
among other factors, have been \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{analysed }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{analyzed }\DIFaddend with models
\citep{Li2016, Samset2018}, showing the existence of feedback mechanisms
between the two. Similar findings have been shown \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{in observational data
\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep[ and references
therein]{Schwarz2020, Ohvril2009, Zerefos2009, Xia2007}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{from the analysis of
observations at other locations
\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{Schwarz2020, Ohvril2009, Zerefos2009, Xia2007} }\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
}{[}\DIFadd{and references
therein}{]}\DIFadd{. In the Mediterranean region, aerosols have been recognized
as an important factor affecting the penetration of solar radiation at
the surface
\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{Fountoulakis2016, Siomos2018, Gkikas2013, Lozano2021}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
. These
studies investigated the long-term trend in aerosol optical depth, which
has been found to decrease in the last three decades, the transport and
composition of aerosols, and their radiative effects}\DIFaddend .

Due to the significant spatial and temporal variability of the trends
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{,
}\DIFdelend and the contributing factors, there is a constant need to monitor and
investigate SDR \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{in }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{at }\DIFaddend different sites in order to estimate the degree of
variability \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, }\DIFdelend and its relation to the local conditions. In this study, we
examine the trends of SDR \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, }\DIFdelend using ground-based measurements at
Thessaloniki, Greece, for the period \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{from }\DIFaddend 1993 to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{2023, as derived from a
CM-21 pyranometer. We reevaluated }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{2023. We re-evaluated
}\DIFaddend and extended the dataset used by \citet{Bais2013}, we applied a
different algorithm for the identification of clear-/cloud-sky instances
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{Reno2016, Reno2012a}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{Reno2016, Reno2012}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend , and we derived the SDR trends for the period
of study \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, }\DIFdelend under different sky conditions (all-sky, clear-sky\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and
cloud-sky}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, and
cloudy-sky}\DIFaddend ). Finally, we investigated the dependence of the trends on
solar zenith angle and season.

The SDR data were measured with a Kipp \& Zonen CM-21 pyranometer
operating continuously at the Laboratory of Atmospheric Physics of the
Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (\(40^\circ\,38'\,\)N,
\(22^\circ\,57'\,\)E, \(80\,\)m~a.s.l.)\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{in }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. Here, we used data for }\DIFaddend the
period from \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{1993-04-13 to 2023-04-13. }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{13~April 1993 to 13~April 2023. }\DIFaddend The monitoring site \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{is }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{was
}\DIFaddend located near the city \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{centre, and we expect to be }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{center, thus we expect that measurements were
}\DIFaddend affected by the urban environment\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, mainly by aerosols}\DIFaddend . During the study
period, the pyranometer \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{has been }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{was }\DIFaddend independently calibrated three times at the
Meteorologisches Observatorium Lindenberg, DWD, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{when it was verified }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{verifying that }\DIFaddend the
stability of the instrument\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{to within }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{'s sensitivity was }\DIFaddend better than \(0.7\%\)
relative to the initial calibration by the manufacturer. Along with SDR,
the direct beam radiation (DNI) was also measured \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{by }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{with }\DIFaddend a collocated Kipp
\& Zonen CHP-1 pyrheliometer \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, for the period 2016-04-01 to 2023-04-13. Although,
we have performed a similar analysis to the DNI data, the results are
not presented here, as they lack the appropriate statistical
significance, due to the sorter duration of the data. However, the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{since 1 April 2016. The }\DIFaddend DNI data were used
as auxiliary data \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, in
the clear sky }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{to support the selection of appropriate thresholds in
the clear-sky }\DIFaddend identification algorithm (CSid), which is discussed \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{later, for the selection of the
appropriate thresholds}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{in
Section \ref{CDIDalgorithm}}\DIFaddend . It is noted that \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{despite the capability of }\DIFdelend the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{CSid algorithm to use the DNI as a characterization parameter, we
haven't utilized it here, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{limited dataset of DNI
was not used for the identification of clear-sky cases in the entire SDR
series }\DIFaddend to avoid any selection bias \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, due to }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{due to the }\DIFaddend unequal length of the two
datasets. There are four distinct steps in the creation of the dataset
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{analysed here: }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{analyzed here: (}\DIFaddend a)~the acquisition of radiation measurements from the
sensors, \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(}\DIFaddend b)~the data quality check, \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(}\DIFaddend c)~the identification of ``clear
sky'' conditions from the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{radiometric }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{SDR }\DIFaddend data, and \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(}\DIFaddend d)~the aggregation of data and
trend analysis.

For the acquisition of radiometric data, the signal of the pyranometer
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{is sampled with }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{was sampled at }\DIFaddend a rate of \(1\,\text{Hz}\). The mean and the standard
deviation of these samples \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{are }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{were calculated and }\DIFaddend recorded every minute.
The measurements \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{are }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{were }\DIFaddend corrected for the zero offset (``dark signal'' in
volts)\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{. The ``dark
signal'' is }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, which was }\DIFaddend calculated by averaging all measurements recorded for
a period of \(3\,\text{h}\), before (morning) or after (evening) the Sun
reaches an elevation angle of \(-10^\circ\). The signal \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{is }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{was }\DIFaddend converted to
irradiance using a ramped value of the instrument's sensitivity between
\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{subsequent }\DIFaddend calibrations.

A manual screening was performed \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, }\DIFdelend to remove inconsistent and erroneous
recordings that can occur stochastically or systematically \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, }\DIFdelend during the
continuous operation of the instruments. The manual screening \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{is }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{was }\DIFaddend aided
by a radiation data quality assurance procedure, adjusted for the site,
which \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{is }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{was }\DIFaddend based on the methods of Long and
Shi~\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citetext{\citeyear{Long2008a}; \citeyear{Long2006}}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{Long2006, Long2008a}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend . Thus, problematic recordings have been
excluded from further processing. Although it is impossible to detect
all false data, the large number of available data, and the aggregation
scheme we used, ensures the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{good
}\DIFdelend quality of the radiation measurements used
in this study.

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{In order to be able }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Due to the significant measurement uncertainty when the Sun is near the
horizon, we have excluded all measurements with solar zenith angle (SZA)
greater than \(85^\circ\). Moreover, due to obstructions around the site
(hills and buildings) that block the direct irradiance, we excluded data
with azimuth angle in the range \(58^{\circ}\)--\(120^{\circ}\) and with
SZA greater than \(78^{\circ}\). To make the measurements comparable
throughout the dataset, we adjusted all one-minute data to the mean
Sun--Earth distance. Subsequently, we adjusted all measurements to the
total solar irradiance (TSI) at \(1\,\text{au}\) in order to compensate
for the Sun's intensity variability using a time series of satellite TSI
observations. The TSI data we used are part of the `NOAA Climate Data
Record of Total Solar Irradiance' dataset \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{Coddington2005}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
. The
initial daily values of this dataset were interpolated to match the time
step of our measurements.
}

\DIFadd{In order }\DIFaddend to estimate the effect of the sky conditions on the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{long term }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{long-term
}\DIFaddend variability of SDR, we created three datasets \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, }\DIFdelend by characterizing each
one-minute measurement with a corresponding \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{sky
condition }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{sky-condition flag }\DIFaddend (i.e.,
all-sky, clear-sky\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend and cloudy-sky). To identify the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{clear-sky conditions we
used a }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{clear cases, we
used the }\DIFaddend method proposed by \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citet{Long2000} }\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
and

\subsection{The Clear Sky Identification
Algorithm}\label{CDIDalgorithm}}

\DIFaddend To calculate the reference \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{clear sky
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{clear-sky }\DIFaddend \(\text{SDR}_\text{CSref}\)\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend we
used the \(\text{SDR}_\text{Haurwitz}\) derived by the radiation model
of \citet{Haurwitz1945} \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(Equation~(\ref{eq:hau}))}\DIFaddend , adjusted for our
site\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{: }\begin{equation}
\DIFadd{\text{SDR}_\text{Haurwitz} = 1098 \times \cos(\theta) \times \exp \left( \frac{ - 0.059}{\cos(\theta)} \right) \label{eq:hau}
}\end{equation} \DIFadd{where \(\theta\) is the SZA.
}

\DIFadd{The adjustment was made }\DIFaddend with a factor \(a\) (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Eq.~\ref{eq:ahau}), resulted by }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Equation~(\ref{eq:ahau})),
which was estimated through }\DIFaddend an iterative optimization process, as
described by \citet{Long2000} and \citet{Reno2016}. The target of the
optimization was the minimization of a function \(f(a)\)
(\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Eq.~\ref{eq:minf}}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Equation~(\ref{eq:minf})}\DIFaddend ) and was accomplished with the algorithmic
function \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{``optimise''}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{`optimise'}\DIFaddend , which is an implementation based on the work of
\citet{Brent1973}, from the library \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{``stats'' }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{`stats' }\DIFaddend of the R programming
language \citep{RCT2023}. \begin{equation}
f(a) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} ( \text{SDR}_{\text{CSid},i} - a \times \text{SDR}_{\text{testCSref},i} )^2 \label{eq:minf}
\end{equation} where \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{: }\DIFdelend \(n\) is the total number of daylight \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{records}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{data}\DIFaddend ,
\(\text{SDR}_{\text{CSid},i}\) are the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{records identified as clear sky
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{data identified as clear-sky }\DIFaddend by
CSid, \(a\) is a \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{hypothetical }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{site-specific }\DIFaddend adjustment factor, and
\(\text{SDR}_{\text{testCSref},i}\) is \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the SDR derived by }\DIFaddend any of the
tested \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{clear sky
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{clear-sky }\DIFaddend radiation models.

The optimization and the selection of the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{clear sky reference model , }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{clear-sky reference model }\DIFaddend was
performed on SDR observations for the period \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{2016 - 2021. }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{2016--2021. }\DIFaddend During the
optimization, eight simple \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{clear sky }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{clear-sky }\DIFaddend radiation models were tested
(namely, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Daneshyar-Paltridge-Proctor, Kasten-Czeplak}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Daneshyar--Paltridge--Proctor, Kasten--Czeplak}\DIFaddend , Haurwitz,

Ineichen-Perez) , }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Berger--Duffie, Adnot--Bourges--Campana--Gicquel, Robledo--Soler,
Kasten, and Ineichen--Perez) }\DIFaddend with a wide range of factors. These models
are described in more \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{details }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{detail }\DIFaddend by \citet{Reno2012} and \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{are }\DIFaddend evaluated by
\citet{Reno2016}. We found \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, }\DIFdelend that Haurwitz's model, adjusted with the
factor \(a = 0.965\)\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend yields one of the lowest root mean squared errors
(RMSE), \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{while the procedure , manages to }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and the procedure manages to successfully }\DIFaddend characterize the
majority of the data. Thus, our clear sky reference is derived by
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the Eq.~\ref{eq:ahau}.
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Equation~(\ref{eq:ahau}): }\DIFaddend \begin{equation}
\text{SDR}_\text{CSref} = a \times \text{SDR}_\text{Haurwitz} = 0.965 \times 1098 \times \cos(\theta) \times \exp \left( \frac{ - 0.057}{\cos(\theta)} \right) \label{eq:ahau}
\end{equation}
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{where: \(\text{SDR}_\text{CSref}\) is the reference clear
sky SDR, in \(\text{W}\,\text{m}^{-2}\) and \(\theta\) is the solar
zenith angle (SZA).
}\DIFdelend 

The criteria that were used to identify whether a measurement was taken
under clear-sky conditions are presented below. A data point is flagged
as \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{``}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{`}\DIFaddend clear-sky\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{'' }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{' }\DIFaddend if all criteria are satisfied\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, otherwise}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{; otherwise, }\DIFaddend it is
considered \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{to be ``}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{as `}\DIFaddend cloud-sky\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{''}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{'}\DIFaddend . Each criterion was applied for a running
window of \(11\) consecutive one-minute measurements, and the
characterization \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{is }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{was }\DIFaddend assigned to the central \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{value }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{datum }\DIFaddend of the window. Each

reference clear sky model, for each comparison}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{in comparison to the

by the model-derived value of the parameter multiplied by a factor plus
an offset. The factors and the offsets were determined empirically \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, }\DIFdelend by
manually inspecting each filter's performance on selected days and
adjusting them accordingly during an iterative process. The criteria are

We calculated the linear \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{SDR trends , }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{trends of SDR }\DIFaddend from the departures of the mean

also contains the \(2\sigma\) standard error, the Pearson's correlation

Figure~\ref{fig:trendALL}\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend we present only the time series under all-sky

taking into account the autocorrelation of the time series, and all
three are statistically significant at least at the \(95\,\%\)
confidence level, as they are larger than the corresponding \(2\sigma\)
errors, despite the small values of R, which is due to the large
variability of the daily values. The clear-sky trend is very small,
suggesting a small effect from aerosols and water vapor, which are the
dominant factors of the SDR variability
\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{Fountoulakis2016, Siomos2018, Yu2022}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
. In contrast, the large
positive trend of SDR under cloudy skies can be attributed to reduction
in cloud cover and/or cloud optical depth. Lack of continuous
observations of cloud optical thickness that could support these
findings does not allow drawing firm conclusions. However, there are
indications that the total cloud cover as inferred from the ERA5
analysis for the grid point of Thessaloniki is decreasing over the

until 2020, with a small positive slope until the present. For a }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{For time series with a }\DIFaddend uniform trend, we would expect the
CUSUMs of the anomalies to have a symmetric `V' shape \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{centered around
the middle of the series}\DIFaddend . This would indicate that the anomalies are
evenly distributed around the climatological mean, and for a positive
uniform trend, the first half \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{to be }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{is }\DIFaddend below and the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{other }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{second }\DIFaddend half above the
climatological mean. In our case, there is a more complex evolution of
the anomalies. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Another
distinct feature of the CUSUMs, is the different pattern of the
cloudy-sky dataset which peaks around the middle of the period.
Although, there seems to exist acomplementary relation to the CUSUMs of
the clear- and all-sky cases, we can not assert that clouds are the main
driver for
this relation due to the great difference in the
number of
observational data between the two datasets
(Table~\ref{tab:trendtable})}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{For all skies (Figure~\ref{fig:cusummonth-1}), we observe
three rather distinct periods: a) a downward part between the start of
the datasets and about 2000, denoting that all anomalies are negative,
thus below the climatology; b) a relatively steady part lasting for
almost 20 years suggesting little variability in SDR anomalies; and c) a
steep upward part to the present indicating anomalies above the
climatology. The CUSUMs for cloudy-skies
(Figure~\ref{fig:cusummonth-3}), show a similar behavior with some
short-term differences that do not change the overall pattern. For clear
skies (Figure~\ref{fig:cusummonth-2}), a monotonic downward tendency is
evident until 2004, suggesting that the anomalies are all negative.
After 2004 the anomalies turn to positive at a fast rate for about five
years and at a slower rate thereafter}\DIFaddend .

In order to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{investigate }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{unveil }\DIFaddend further the features of the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{CUSUMs, we created
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{variability of the three
datasets, Figure~\ref{fig:cusumnotrendmonthly} presents }\DIFaddend another set of
CUSUM plots \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{by subtracting the corresponding long term
trend from the SDR anomaly data, prior to the CUSUM calculation
(Figure~\ref{fig:cusumnotrendmonthly})}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{using anomalies after the long-term linear trend is removed}\DIFaddend .
With this approach\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend periods when the CUSUMs diverge from zero can be
interpreted as a systematic variation of SDR from the climatological
mean. When the CUSUM is increasing, the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{added }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{anomalies }\DIFaddend values are above the
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{climatological values of the
SDR trend }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{climatology }\DIFaddend and vice versa. Overall, for all- and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{clear-sky }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{cloudy-sky }\DIFaddend conditions
(Figures~\ref{fig:cusumnotrendmonthly-1}
and~\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\ref{fig:cusumnotrendmonthly-2}}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\ref{fig:cusumnotrendmonthly-3}}\DIFaddend ) we observe periods \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{when the
anomalies
diverge }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{with anomalies
diverging }\DIFaddend from the climatological \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{value}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{values}\DIFaddend , each lasting for several
years. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{These fluctuations are probably within the natural variability
and no distinct changes are identified. }\DIFaddend The pattern in both datasets is
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{very }\DIFdelend similar, suggesting prevalence in \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{clear }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{cloudy }\DIFaddend skies over Thessaloniki. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{It is interesting that in

}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{For
clear skies }\DIFaddend (Figure~\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\ref{fig:cusumnotrendmonthly-3}) the period 1997 - 2008 is dominated by positive CUSUMs, suggesting a reduced effect of clouds on
SDR. From 1997 to mid-2000s CUSUMs are increasing, likely due to a
continuous decrease in the
optical thickness of clouds, followed by a
period of rapid increase (within 3 years) in cloud optical thickness
lasting up to 2008. The following stable period spans for about 15 years
up to 2021 when CUSUMs start increasing again }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\ref{fig:cusumnotrendmonthly-2}) the distinct change
in 2004 is now clearer. The most likely reason for this change is the
monotonic reduction of aerosols in Thessaloniki. At that year there a
change in the rate of decrease in aerosol optical depth as illustrated
in Figure 7 of \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citet{Siomos2020}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
. This abrupt change in CUSUMs lasts
until about 2010 when the anomalies become again variable}\DIFaddend .

\DIFaddend 

The solar zenith angle is a major factor \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{of SDR reaching the ground, due
to the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{affecting the SDR, since
increases in SZA leads to }\DIFaddend enhancement of the radiation path in the
atmosphere, especially in urban environments with human activities
emitting aerosols \citep{Wang2021}. In order to estimate the effect of
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the }\DIFdelend SZA on the SDR trends, we grouped the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{anomaly }\DIFdelend data in bins of \(1^\circ\) SZA,
and calculated the overall trend for each bin\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, separately for the daily
periods }\DIFaddend before noon and after noon (Figure~\ref{fig:szatrends}).
Although there are seasonal dependencies of the minimum SZA (see
Appendix, Figure~\ref{fig:SZAtrendSeason}), these dependencies \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{would not
be furtherexamined here.
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{are not
discussed further.
}

\DIFaddend For all-sky \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and
clear-sky }\DIFdelend conditions the brightening effect of SDR (positive trend)
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{is
stronger for large }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{increases with }\DIFaddend SZAs (Figures~\ref{fig:szatrends-1}\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and
\ref{fig:szatrends-2}) }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{) ranging from about
\(0.1\,\%/y\) to about \(0.7\,\%/y\) for the statistically significant
trends}\DIFaddend . The trends in the morning and afternoon hours are more or less
consistent with small differences \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{at small SZAs }\DIFaddend which can be attributed
to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{systematic diurnal variations of aerosols
, particularly
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{effects on clear sky SDR from systematic diurnal patterns of aerosols
during the warm period of the year, consistently with the results
reported for China by \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citet{Wang2021}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD

\(25^\circ\) can only occur }\DIFaddend during the warm period of the year \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{Wang2021}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
. }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{around
noon when clear skies are more frequent. The increasing trend with SZA
is likely caused by the increased attenuation of SDR with SZA. The
effect is larger when aerosol and/or cloud layers are optically thicker,
therefore, decreases in aerosol and clouds through the study period will
result in larger positive trends of SDR at larger SZAs.
}

\DIFadd{Under clear skies (Figures~\ref{fig:szatrends-2}), the trends are
smaller and less variable, ranging between \(0.1\) and \(0.15\,\%/y\) up
to \(77^\circ\) SZA. At higher SZAs and in the afternoon hours there a
sharp increase in the trend up to \(0.3\,\%/y\), which may have been
caused by the long path length of radiation through the atmosphere as
discussed above for the all-sky conditions. The small differences in the
trend between morning and afternoon between \(35^\circ\) and
\(60^\circ\) SZA is likely a result of less attenuation of SDR in the
morning hours due to lesser amounts of aerosols and shallower boundary
layer.
}

\DIFaddend For cloudy-sky conditions (Figure~\ref{fig:szatrends-3}), we \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{can not }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{cannot
}\DIFaddend discern any significant dependence of the SDR trend with SZA \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{. For SZAs \(16^\circ\)
- \(50^\circ\), the trends range within about \(\pm 0.2\,\%/y\), with a
weak statistical significance. Between \(50^\circ\) and \(75^\circ\) SZA
the trends for the period before noon are stronger and negative, possibly }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{as the
variability of irradiance is dominated by the cloud effects leading to
insignificant trends. Statistically significant trends appear only in
the afternoon and for SZAs larger than \(60^\circ\). The sharp increase
of the trend at SZAs larger than \(\sim{75}^{\circ}\), observed also for
clear skies, is probably }\DIFaddend associated with stronger attenuation by clouds
under oblique incidence angles\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, which result also in smaller
variability}\DIFaddend .

Similarly to the long term trends \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{from daily means of SDR }\DIFaddend discussed

error, the Pearson's correlation coefficient R and the corresponding
p-value. The winter linear trends exhibit generally the largest R values
ranging between \(0.54\) and \(0.60\,\%/y\). }\DIFaddend For all-sky conditions the
trend in SDR in winter is the largest (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\(0.69\,\%/y\)}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\(0.7\,\%/y\)}\DIFaddend ), followed by the
trend in autumn (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\(0.43\,\%/y\)}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\(0.42\,\%/y\)}\DIFaddend , a value close to the long term trend)
both statistically significant \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{above
the \(99\,\%\) }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{at the \(95\,\%\) }\DIFaddend confidence level. In
spring and summer, the trends are much smaller and of lesser statistical
significance. These seasonal differences indicate a possible relation of
the trends in SDR to trends \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{of }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{in }\DIFaddend clouds during winter and autumn. For
clear-skies, the trend in winter is \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\(0.83\,\%/y\), larger than }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\(0.4\,\%/y\) and is associated with
the decreasing trend in aerosol optical depth \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{Siomos2020}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
.
Moreover, it is almost half of that }\DIFaddend for all-skies\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{(\(0.69\,\%/y\))}\DIFdelend , which is another
indication of a decreasing trend in cloud optical thickness. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Moreover, the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{In other
seasons the clear-sky trend is very small (below \(0.1\,\%/y\)).
Finally, for cloudy-skies the winter trend is the largest
(\(0.76\,\%/y\)) and greater than for all-skies, followed by a much
smaller trend in autumn (\(0.19\,\%/y\)).
}

\DIFadd{The }\DIFaddend trends under clear- and cloudy-sky conditions are \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{almost
complementary to each other, particularly for winterand autumn, where

}\DIFaddend increase of this trend indicates that the brightening of SDR continues
and is \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{probably }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{likely }\DIFaddend caused by continuing decreases in aerosol optical depth
and the optical thickness of clouds over the area. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Moreover, we found a similar trend }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{A smaller trend has

the notion that part of }\DIFaddend the brightening is caused \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{mainly }\DIFdelend by decreasing
aerosols. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Unfortunately,
for the entire period there is no available data for the aerosols, in
order to quantify their effect on SDR. However, }\DIFdelend \citet{Siomos2020} have shown that aerosol optical depth over
Thessaloniki is decreasing constantly at least up to 2018. The
attenuation of SDR by aerosols over Europe \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{have }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{has }\DIFaddend been proposed as major
factor by \citet{Wild2021}. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The
dimming }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Unfortunately, for this study aerosol data
for the entire period were not available in order to quantify their
effect on SDR. The brightening }\DIFaddend effect on SDR under cloudy-sky conditions
(\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\(-0.28\,\%/y\)}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\(0.41\,\%/y\)}\DIFaddend ), suggests that cloud optical thickness is \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{also

The observed brightening on SDR over Thessaloniki is dependent on SZA
(larger SZAs lead to stronger brightening). The trend is also dependent
on season, with winter showing the strongest statistically significant
trend of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\(0.69\) and \(0.83\,\%/y\) }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\(0.7\) and \(0.76\,\%/y\) }\DIFaddend for all- and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{clear-skies}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{cloudy-skies}\DIFaddend ,
respectively, in contrast to spring and summer. The trends for autumn
are also significant but smaller (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\(0.43\) and \(0.37\,\%/y\) }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\(0.42\) and \(0.19\,\%/y\) }\DIFaddend for all-
and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{clear-skies}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{cloudy-skies}\DIFaddend , respectively). \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Our findings are in agreement with other
studies for the region}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The trend for clear skies is largest in
winter (\(0.4\,\%/y\)) and negligible in spring, summer and autumn}\DIFaddend .

Using the CUSUMs of the monthly departures for all- and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{clear-skies}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{cloudy-skies}\DIFaddend , we
observed \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{periods }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{a 20-year period starting around 2000 }\DIFaddend where the CUSUMs remain
relatively stable, with a steep decline before and a steep increase
after. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{This is an indication that the whole brightening effect does not follow a smooth development over
time}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The rather smooth course of the CUSUMs suggests that no important
change in the SDR pattern has occurred in the entire record}\DIFaddend .

Continued observations with a collocated pyrheliometer, which started in
2016, will allow us to further investigate the variability of solar
radiation at ground level in Thessaloniki. Also, additional data of
cloudiness, aerosols, atmospheric water vapour, etc., will allow better
attribution and quantification of the effects of these factors on SRD.
