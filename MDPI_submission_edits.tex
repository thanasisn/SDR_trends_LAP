\abstract{The shortwave downward solar irradiance (SDR) is an important
factor that drives climate processes, production and can affect all
living organisms. Observations of SDR at different locations around the
world with different environmental characteristics have been used to
investigate its long-term variability and trends at different time
scales. Periods of positive trends are referred as brightening periods
and of negative trends as dimming periods. Here we studied 30 years of
pyranometer data in Thessaloniki, Greece, under three types of sky
conditions (clear sky, cloudy sky and all sky). The clear-sky data were
identified by applying a cloud screening algorithm. We found a positive
trend of \(0.38\,\%/\text{year}\) for all-sky, \(0.35\,\%/\text{year}\)
for clear-sky conditions, and \(-0.28\,\%/\text{year}\) for cloudy
conditions. We have also investigated the consistency of these trends,
their seasonal variability, and the effect of the solar zenith angle. We
have found that for all-sky and clear-sky conditions the SDR trend is
positive in winter (\(0.7\) and \(0.8\,\%/\text{year}\), respectively)
and autumn (\(~0.4\,\%/\text{year}\)), while under cloudy skies the
trend is negative (\(-0.9\,\%/\text{year}\) in winter and
\(-0.4\,\%/\text{year}\) in autumn). In spring and summer the trend is
very close to zero, irrespective of sky conditions. The SDR trend is
increasing with increasing solar zenith angle, except under cloudy skies
where the trend is highly variable and close to zero. Finally, we
identified some anomalies in the long term SDR trends for all sky
conditions by examining the cumulative sums of monthly anomalies from
the climatological mean.}

The shortwave downward solar irradiance (SDR) at Earth's surface plays a
significant role, on its climate. Changes of the SDR can be related to
changes on Earth's energy budget, the mechanisms of climate change, and
water and carbon cycles \citep{Wild2009}. It can also affect solar and
agricultural production, and all living organisms. Studies of SDR
variability, have identified some distinct SDR trends on different
regions of the world on different time periods. The term `brightening'
is generally used to describe periods of positive SDR trend, and
`dimming' for negative trend \citep{Wild2009}. There are many cases in
the long term records of irradiance, showing a systematic change in the
magnitude of the trend, occurring roughly in the last decades of the
20th century. On multiple stations in China, a dimming period was
reported until about 2000, followed by a brightening period
\citep{Yang2021}. A similar pattern was identified, with the breaking
point around 1980, for stations in Central Europe \citep{Wild2021} and
Brazil \citep{Yamasoe2021}. On global scale, an artificial Intelligence
aided spatial analysis on continental level with data from multiple
stations reach similar conclusions for these regions and for the global
trend \citep{Yuan2021}.

There is a consensus among researchers that the major factor affecting
the variability of SDR attenuation is the interactions of solar
radiation with atmospheric aerosols and clouds. Those interactions,
among other factors, have been analysed with models
\citep{Li2016, Samset2018}, showing the existence of feedback mechanisms
between the two. Similar findings have been shown in observational data
\citep[ and references
therein]{Schwarz2020, Ohvril2009, Zerefos2009, Xia2007}.

Due to the significant spatial and temporal variability of the trends,
and the contributing factors, there is a constant need to monitor and
investigate SDR in different sites in order to estimate the degree of
variability, and its relation to the local conditions. In this study, we
examine the trends of SDR, using ground-based measurements at
Thessaloniki, Greece, for the period 1993 to 2023, as derived from a
CM-21 pyranometer. We reevaluated and extended the dataset used by
\citet{Bais2013}, we applied a different algorithm for the
identification of clear-/cloud-sky instances
\citep{Reno2016, Reno2012a}, and we derived the SDR trends for the
period of study, under different sky conditions (all-sky, clear-sky and
cloud-sky). Finally, we investigated the dependence of the trends on
solar zenith angle and season.

The SDR data were measured with a Kipp \& Zonen CM-21 pyranometer
operating continuously at the Laboratory of Atmospheric Physics of the
Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (\(40^\circ\,38'\,\)N,
\(22^\circ\,57'\,\)E, \(80\,\)m~a.s.l.) \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{in }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{since 1993. Here we use data for
}\DIFaddend the period from 1993-04-13 to 2023-04-13. The monitoring site is located
near the city centre \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, and we expect to be }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{thus we expect that measurements are }\DIFaddend affected by
the urban environment. During the study period, the pyranometer has been
independently calibrated three times at the Meteorologisches
Observatorium Lindenberg, DWD, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{when it was verified the
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{verifying that }\DIFaddend stability of the
instrument\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{to within }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{'s sensitivity is }\DIFaddend better than \(0.7\%\) relative to the
initial calibration by the manufacturer. Along with SDR, the direct beam
radiation (DNI) \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{was also measured by }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{is also measured with }\DIFaddend a collocated Kipp \& Zonen CHP-1
pyrheliometer \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, for the period }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{since }\DIFaddend 2016-04-01\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{to 2023-04-13. Although,
we have performed a similar analysis to the DNI data, the results are
not presented here, as they lack the appropriate statistical
significance, due to the sorter duration of the data. However, the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. The }\DIFaddend DNI data were used as auxiliary data
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{to support the selection of appropriate thresholds }\DIFaddend in the clear sky
identification algorithm (CSid), which is discussed later\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, for the selection of the
appropriate thresholds}\DIFdelend . It is noted
that \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{despite the capability of }\DIFdelend the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{CSid algorithm to use the DNI as a characterization parameter, we
haven't utilized it here, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{limited dataset of DNI was not used for the identification of
clear sky cases in the entire SDR series }\DIFaddend to avoid any selection bias \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, }\DIFdelend due
to unequal length of the two datasets. There are four distinct steps in
the creation of the dataset \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{analysed }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{analyzed }\DIFaddend here: a)~the acquisition of
radiation measurements from the sensors, b)~the data quality check,
c)~the identification of ``clear sky'' conditions from the radiometric
data, and d)~the aggregation of data and trend analysis.

For the acquisition of radiometric data, the signal of the pyranometer
is sampled \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{with }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{at }\DIFaddend a rate of \(1\,\text{Hz}\). The mean and the standard
deviation of these samples are \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{calculated and }\DIFaddend recorded every minute. The
measurements are corrected for the zero offset (``dark signal'' in
volts)\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{. The ``dark
signal'' }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, which }\DIFaddend is calculated by averaging all measurements recorded for a
period of \(3\,\text{h}\), before (morning) or after (evening) the Sun
reaches an elevation angle of \(-10^\circ\). The signal is converted to
irradiance using a ramped value of the instrument's sensitivity between
\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{subsequent }\DIFaddend calibrations.

A manual screening was performed, to remove inconsistent and erroneous
recordings that can occur stochastically or systematically, during the
continuous operation of the instruments. The manual screening is aided
by a radiation data quality assurance procedure, adjusted for the site,
which is based on the methods of Long and
Shi~\citetext{\citeyear{Long2008a}; \citeyear{Long2006}}. Thus,
problematic recordings have been excluded from further processing.
Although it is impossible to detect all false data, the large number of
available data, and the aggregation scheme we used, ensures the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{good
}\DIFdelend quality
of the radiation measurements used in this study.

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{In order to be able }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Due to the significant measurement uncertainty when the Sun is near the
horizon, we have excluded all measurements with SZA greater than
\(85^\circ\). Moreover, due to obstructions around the site (hills and
buildings) which block the direct irradiance, we excluded data with
azimuth angle in the range \(58^{\circ}\) - \(120^{\circ}\) and with SZA
greater than \(78^{\circ}\). To make the measurements comparable
throughout the dataset, we adjusted all one-minute data to the mean Sun
- Earth distance. Subsequently, we adjusted all measurements to the
Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) at \(1\,\text{au}\), in order to compensate
for the Sun's intensity variability, using a time series of satellite
TSI observations. The TSI data we used are part of the ``NOAA Climate
Data Record of Total Solar Irradiance'' dataset \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{Coddington2005}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
.
The initial daily values of this dataset were interpolated to match the
time step of our measurements.
}

\DIFadd{In order }\DIFaddend to estimate the effect of the sky conditions on the long term
variability of SDR, we created three datasets \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, }\DIFdelend by characterizing each
one-minute measurement with a corresponding \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{sky
condition }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{sky-condition flag }\DIFaddend (i.e.,
all-sky, clear-sky and cloudy-sky). To identify the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{clear-sky conditions }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{clear-cases }\DIFaddend we used
a method proposed by \citet{Long2000} and by \citet{Reno2016}, which
were adapted and configured for the site \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, as
the authors suggest. }%DIFDELCMD <

\DIFdel{We have to note , that

all methods have some subjectivity in }\DIFaddend the definition of clear or cloudy

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, it relies }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and they rely }\DIFaddend on a combination of thresholds and comparisons with ideal
radiation models and statistical analysis of different signal metrics.
The CSid algorithm was calibrated with the main focus, to identify the

along with the site specific thresholds.
\DIFaddbegin 

\hypertarget{the-clear-sky-identification-algorithm}{%
\subsection{The clear sky identification
algorithm}\label{the-clear-sky-identification-algorithm}}

\DIFaddend To calculate the reference \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{clear sky
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{clear-sky }\DIFaddend \(\text{SDR}_\text{CSref}\) we used
the \(\text{SDR}_\text{Haurwitz}\) derived by the radiation model of
\citet{Haurwitz1945} \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(Eq.~\ref{eq:hau})}\DIFaddend , adjusted for our site\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{:
}\begin{equation}
\DIFadd{\text{SDR}_\text{Haurwitz} = 1098 \times \cos(\theta) \times \exp \left( \frac{ - 0.057}{\cos(\theta)} \right) \label{eq:hau}
}\end{equation} \DIFadd{where \(\theta\) is the solar zenith angle (SZA).
}

\DIFadd{The adjustment was made }\DIFaddend with a factor \(a\) (Eq.~\ref{eq:ahau}), \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{resulted by }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{which
was estimated through }\DIFaddend an iterative optimization process, as described by
\citet{Long2000} and \citet{Reno2016}. The target of the optimization
was the minimization of a function \(f(a)\) (Eq.~\ref{eq:minf}) and was
accomplished with the algorithmic function ``optimise'', which is an
implementation based on the work of \citet{Brent1973}, from the library
``stats'' of the R programming language \citep{RCT2023}.
\begin{equation}
f(a) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} ( \text{SDR}_{\text{CSid},i} - a \times \text{SDR}_{\text{testCSref},i} )^2 \label{eq:minf}
\end{equation} where: \(n\) is the total number of daylight \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{records}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{data}\DIFaddend ,
\(\text{SDR}_{\text{CSid},i}\) are the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{records }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{data }\DIFaddend identified as clear sky by
CSid, \(a\) is a \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{hypothetical }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{site-specific }\DIFaddend adjustment factor, and
\(\text{SDR}_{\text{testCSref},i}\) is \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the SDR derived by }\DIFaddend any of the
tested \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{clear sky
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{clear-sky }\DIFaddend radiation models.

The optimization and the selection of the clear sky reference model, was
performed on SDR observations for the period 2016 - 2021. During the
optimization, eight simple clear sky radiation models were tested
(namely, Daneshyar-Paltridge-Proctor, Kasten-Czeplak, Haurwitz,
Berger-Duffie, Adnot-Bourges-Campana-Gicquel, Robledo-Soler, Kasten and
Ineichen-Perez), with a wide range of factors. These models are
described in more details by \citet{Reno2012} and evaluated by
\citet{Reno2016}. We found, that Haurwitz's model, adjusted with the
factor \(a = 0.965\) yields one of the lowest root mean squared errors
(RMSE), while the procedure \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, }\DIFdelend manages to characterize \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{successfully }\DIFaddend the
majority of the data. Thus, our clear sky reference is derived by the
Eq.~\ref{eq:ahau}\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{.
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{: }\DIFaddend \begin{equation}
\text{SDR}_\text{CSref} = a \times \text{SDR}_\text{Haurwitz} = 0.965 \times 1098 \times \cos(\theta) \times \exp \left( \frac{ - 0.057}{\cos(\theta)} \right) \label{eq:ahau}
\end{equation}
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{where: \(\text{SDR}_\text{CSref}\) is the reference clear
sky SDR, in \(\text{W}\,\text{m}^{-2}\) and \(\theta\) is the solar
zenith angle (SZA).
}\DIFdelend 

The criteria that were used to identify whether a measurement was taken
under clear-sky conditions are presented below. A data point is flagged
as ``clear-sky'' if all criteria are satisfied\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{; }\DIFaddend otherwise it is
considered \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{to be }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{as }\DIFaddend ``cloud-sky''. Each criterion was applied for a running
window of \(11\) consecutive one-minute measurements, and the
characterization \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{is }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{was }\DIFaddend assigned to the central \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{value }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{datum }\DIFaddend of the window. Each
parameter, was calculated both from the observations and the reference
clear sky model, for each comparison. The allowable range of variation
is defined by the model-derived value of the parameter multiplied by a
factor plus an offset. The factors and the offsets were determined
empirically, by manually inspecting each filter's performance on
selected days and adjusting them accordingly during an iterative
process. The criteria are \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{listed below, together with the range of

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Due to the significant measurement uncertainty when the Sun is near the

and cloud-sky conditions, are \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{very similar and are }\DIFdelend shown in the Appendix
(Figures~\ref{fig:trendCLEAR} and~ \ref{fig:trendCLOUD}). \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{We observe a

clear-sky trend is very small suggesting a small effect from aerosols
and water vapor which are the dominant factors of the SDR variability.
In contrast the large positive trend of SDR under cloudy skies can be
attributed to reduction in cloud cover and/or cloud optical depth. Lack
of continuous cloud observations that could support these findings does
not allow drawing firm conclusions. However, there are indications that
the total cloud-cover as inferred from the ERA5 analysis for the grid

Although the year-to-year variability of the anomalies (Figure
\ref{fig:trendALL} and Figures\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{~}\DIFaddend \ref{fig:trendCLEAR},
\ref{fig:trendCLOUD} in Appendix), shows a rather homogeneous behaviour,
plots of the cumulative sums (CUSUM) \citep{Regier2019} of the anomalies
can reveal different structures in the records of all three sky
conditions. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{In the cases of all-sky and clear-sky conditions (Figures
\ref{fig:cusummonth-1} and \ref{fig:cusummonth-2}), we observe three
macroscopic periods. A downward part from the start until about 2005, a
relatively steady part until about 2016 and, finally, a steep upward
part until the present. For cloud-sky (Figure~\ref{fig:cusummonth-3}),
we have a different pattern; it begins with a relatively steady part
until 1997, followed by an upward part until 2005, and a long decline
until 2020, with a small positive slope until the present. For a }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{For time series with a }\DIFaddend uniform trend, we would expect the
CUSUMs of the anomalies to have a symmetric `V' shape \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{centered around
the middle of the series}\DIFaddend . This would indicate that the anomalies are
evenly distributed around the climatological mean, and for a positive
uniform trend, the first half \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{to be }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{is }\DIFaddend below and the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{other }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{second }\DIFaddend half above the
climatological mean. In our case, there is a more complex evolution of
the anomalies. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Another
distinct feature of the CUSUMs, is the different pattern of the
cloudy-sky dataset which peaks around the middle of the period.
Although, there seems to exist acomplementary relation to the CUSUMs of
the clear- and all-sky cases, we can not assert that clouds are the main
driver for
this relation due to the great difference in the number of
observational data between the
two datasets
(Table~\ref{tab:trendtable})}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{For all-skies (Figure~\ref{fig:cusummonth-1}), we observe
three rather distinct periods: a) a downward part between the start of
the datasets and about 2000, denoting that all anomalies are negative
thus below the climatology; b) a relatively steady part lasting for
almost 20 years suggesting little variability in SDR anomalies; and c) a
steep upward part to present indicating anomalies above the climatology.
The CUSUMs for cloudy-skies (Figure~\ref{fig:cusummonth-3}), show a
similar behavior with some short-term differences that do not change the
overall pattern. For clear skies (Figure~\ref{fig:cusummonth-2}), a
monotonic downward tendency is evident until 2004, suggesting that the
anomalies are all negative. After 2004 the anomalies turn to positive at
a fast rate for about five years and at a slower rate thereafter}\DIFaddend .

In order to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{investigate }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{unveil }\DIFaddend further the features of the \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{variability of the three
datasets, Figure~\ref{fig:cusumnotrendmonthly} of the }\DIFaddend CUSUMs, we created
another set of CUSUM plots by subtracting the corresponding long term
trend from the SDR anomaly data, prior to the CUSUM calculation
(Figure~\ref{fig:cusumnotrendmonthly}). With this approach periods when
the CUSUMs diverge from zero can be interpreted as a systematic
variation of SDR from the climatological mean. When the CUSUM is
increasing, the added values are above the climatological values of the
SDR trend and vice versa. Overall, for all- and clear-sky conditions
(Figures~\ref{fig:cusumnotrendmonthly-1}
and~\ref{fig:cusumnotrendmonthly-2}) we observe periods when the
anomalies diverge from the climatological value, each lasting for
several years. The pattern in both datasets is very similar, suggesting
prevalence in clear skies over Thessaloniki. It is interesting that in
the period 1993 - 2016 the anomalies have a high variability around
zero, while after 2016, the range of the variability is decreased to
about one third of the prior period. For cloudy-sky conditions
(Figure~\ref{fig:cusumnotrendmonthly-3}) the period 1997 - 2008 is
dominated by positive CUSUMs, suggesting a reduced effect of clouds on
SDR. From 1997 to mid-2000s CUSUMs are increasing, likely due to a
continuous decrease in the optical thickness of clouds, followed by a
period of rapid increase (within 3 years) in cloud optical thickness
lasting up to 2008. The following stable period spans for about 15 years
up to 2021 when CUSUMs start increasing again.

The solar zenith angle is a major factor \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{of SDR reaching the ground, due
to the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{affecting the SDR, since
increases in SZA leads to }\DIFaddend enhancement of the radiation path in the
atmosphere, especially in urban environments with human activities

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the }\DIFdelend SZA on the SDR trends, we grouped the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{anomaly }\DIFdelend data in bins of \(1^\circ\) SZA,
and calculated the overall trend for each bin\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, separately for the daily
periods }\DIFaddend before noon and after noon (Figure~\ref{fig:szatrends}).
Although there are seasonal dependencies of the minimum SZA (see
Appendix, Figure~\ref{fig:SZAtrendSeason}), these dependencies \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{would not

}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{are not
discussed further.

\DIFaddend For all-sky \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and
clear-sky }\DIFdelend conditions the brightening effect of SDR (positive trend) is
stronger for large SZAs (Figures~\ref{fig:szatrends-1} and
\ref{fig:szatrends-2}) \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ranging from about \(0.1\,\%/y\) to about
\(0.7\,\%/y\)}\DIFaddend . The trends in the morning and afternoon hours are more or
less consistent with small differences \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{at small SZAs }\DIFaddend which can be
attributed to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{systematic diurnal variations of aerosols , particularly

that SZAs less than \(35^\circ\) can only occur during the warm period

}

\DIFaddend For cloudy-sky conditions (Figure~\ref{fig:szatrends-3}), we can not

is \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\(0.83\,\%/y\)}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\(0.4\,\%/y\)}\DIFaddend , larger than for all-skies (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\(0.69\,\%/y\)}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\(0.7\,\%/y\)}\DIFaddend ), which is
another indication of a decreasing trend in cloud optical thickness.
Moreover, the trends under clear- and cloudy-sky conditions are almost
complementary to each other, particularly for winter and autumn, where
the signal is stronger. During spring and summer the statistical
significance is very low and the actual trend too small for a meaningful
comparison.

\section{Conclusions}\label{conclusions}}

We have \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{demonstrated that in the period }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{analyzed a 30 year dataset of SRD measurements in Thessaloniki
Greece (}\DIFaddend 1993 \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{- }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{-- }\DIFaddend 2023\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{) aiming to identify the long term variability of
solar irradiance under different sky conditions. Under all-sky
conditions }\DIFaddend there is a positive trend in SDR of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{(}\DIFdelend \(0.38\,\%/y\)
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{) }\DIFdelend (brightening)\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{(positive trend) in
Thessaloniki, Greece, under all-sky conditions}\DIFdelend . A previous study \citep{Bais2013} for the period 1993 \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{- }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{--
}\DIFaddend 2011 \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{found }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{reported }\DIFaddend also a positive trend\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend of \(0.33\,\%/y\). The \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{slight
}\DIFaddend increase of this trend indicates that the brightening of SDR continues
and is probably caused by continuing decreases in aerosol optical depth
and the optical thickness of clouds over the area. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Moreover, we found a similar trend }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{A smaller trend has
been found }\DIFaddend under clear-sky conditions (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\(0.35\,\%/y\)}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\(0.1\,\%/y\)}\DIFaddend ) that further
supports the assumption that the brightening is caused mainly by
decreasing aerosols. Unfortunately, for the entire period there is no
available data for the aerosols, in order to quantify their effect on
SDR. However, \citet{Siomos2020} have shown that aerosol optical depth
over Thessaloniki is decreasing constantly at least up to 2018. The
attenuation of SDR by aerosols over Europe have been proposed as major
factor by \citet{Wild2021}. The dimming effect on SDR under cloudy-sky
conditions (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\(-0.28\,\%/y\)}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\(0.41\,\%/y\)}\DIFaddend ), suggests that cloud optical thickness is
decreasing during this period. Because we have no adequate data to
investigate the long term changes of cloud thickness in the region, we
cannot verify if the negative SDR trend we observe under under
cloudy-skies can be attributed solely to changes in clouds.

The observed brightening on SDR over Thessaloniki is dependent on SZA
(larger SZAs lead to stronger brightening). The trend is also dependent
on season, with winter showing the strongest statistically significant
trend of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\(0.69\) and \(0.83\,\%/y\) }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\(0.7\) and \(0.4\,\%/y\) }\DIFaddend for all- and clear-skies,
respectively, in contrast to spring and summer. The trends for autumn
are also significant but smaller ( \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\(0.43\) and \(0.37\,\%/y\) }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\(0.42\) and \(0.05\,\%/y\) }\DIFaddend for all-
and clear-skies, respectively). Our findings are in agreement with other
studies for the region.

Using the CUSUMs of the monthly departures for all- and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{clear-skies}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{cloudy-skies}\DIFaddend , we
observed \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{periods }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{a 20 year period starting around 2000 }\DIFaddend where the CUSUMs remain
relatively stable, with a steep decline before and a steep increase
after. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{This is an indication that the whole brightening effect does not follow a smooth development over
time}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The rather smooth course of the CUSUMs suggests that no important
change in the SDR pattern has occurred in the entire record}\DIFaddend .

Continued observations with a collocated pyrheliometer, which started in
2016, will allow us to further investigate the variability of solar
radiation at ground level in Thessaloniki. Also, additional data of
cloudiness, aerosols, atmospheric water vapour, etc., will allow better
attribution and quantification of the effects of these factors on SRD.
