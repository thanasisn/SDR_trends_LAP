The methodology has been developed using data from the US Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Meas- urement (ARM) Program. The testing includes physically possible limits as determined by the World Meteorological Or- ganization (WMO) Baseline Surface Radiation Network, as well as user configurable limits based on climatological analysis of data collected at the measurement site. The algorithm can be run in near real time, or more typically on a daily basis. Additionally, longer monthly or yearly runs can be used to assess more subtle tendencies and problems in the data through evaluation of daily summaries of quality flagging.},

radiation measurements to define reasonable limits for testing the data for unusual data values. The main
assumption is that the majority of the climatological data are “good” data, which for field sites operated
with care such as those of the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program is a reasonable
assumption. Data that fall outside the normal range of occurrences are labeled either “indeterminate”
(meaning that the measurements are possible, but rarely occurring, and thus the values cannot be
identified as good) or “bad” depending on how far outside the normal range the particular data reside.
The methodology not only sets fairly standard maximum and minimum value limits, but also compares
what we have learned about the behavior of these instruments in the field to other value-added products
(VAPs), such as the Diffuse infrared (IR) Loss Correction VAP (Younkin and Long 2004) and the Best
Estimate Flux VAP (Shi and Long 2002).},

  abstract  = {We present an automated method to identify periods of clear skies for a 160° field of view using only 1-min measurements of surface downwelling total and diffuse shortwave irradiance. The clear-sky detection method is verified using Whole Sky Imager and lidar data, observer reports, and model comparisons. Identified clear-sky irradiance measurements are then used to empirically fit clear-sky irradiance functions using the cosine of the solar zenith angle as the independent variable. These fitted functions produce continuous estimates of clear-sky total, diffuse, and direct component shortwave irradiances. While this method ignores diurnal changes in such variables as column water vapor and aerosol amounts and changes between clear-sky days, it is shown that the resultant clear-sky irradiance estimates have RMS uncertainty comparable to the uncertainty of the measuring instruments themselves. The estimated clear-sky irradiances are used to estimate the effect of clouds on the downwelling shortwave irradiance as a difference between the measured and clear-sky amounts. We show that the cloud effect calculations from this method appear to decrease the uncertainty due to systematic pyranometer offsets and cosine response errors. Thus any data set that includes downwelling diffuse and total shortwave measurements can be processed to identify clear-sky periods and produce estimates of clear-sky irradiance and cloud effects.},

These measurements were recorded during a measurement campaign between May and October 2012, aimed at studying the influence of atmospheric compounds on solar radiation transfer through the atmosphere. The effects of TOC, AOD and w on UVER and SW (global, diffuse and direct) irradiance were quantified using irradiance values under cloud-free conditions at different fixed solar zenith angles (SZA). Results show that UVER (but not SW) irradiance correlates well with TOC. UVER variations ranged between-0.24%DU-1 and-0.32%DU-1 with all changes being statistically significant. Global SW irradiance varies with water vapour column between-2.44%cm-1 and-4.53%cm-1, these results proving statistically significant and diminishing when SZA increases. The irradiance variations range between 42.15%cm-1 and 20.30%cm-1 for diffuse SW when SZA varies between 20° and 70°. The effect of aerosols on global UVER is stronger than on global SW. Aerosols cause a UVER reduction of between 28.12% and 52.41% and a global SW reduction between 13.46% and 41.41% per AOD550 unit. Empirical results show that solar position plays a determinant role, that there is a negligible effect of ozone on SW radiation, and stronger attenuation by aerosol particles in UVER radiation.},

Aerosol properties derived from Sun photometer measurements and aerosol-induced changes in downwelling shortwave surface irradiances are analyzed in this paper. It is shown that the mean aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 500 nm is 0.63. The day-to-day variation of aerosol optical depth is dramatic, with a maximum daily AOD close to 2.0 and a minimum value close to the background level. Dust activities generally produce heavy aerosol loading characterized by larger particle sizes and less absorption than those observed under normal conditions. The reduction of instantaneous direct shortwave surface irradiance per unit of AOD is 404.5 W M<sup>-2</sup>. About 63.8% of this reduction is offset by an increase in diffuse irradiance; consequently, one unit increase in AOD leads to a decrease in global surface irradiance of 146.3 W m<sup>-2</sup>. The diurnal aerosol direct radiative forcing efficiency is about -47.4 W m<sup>-2</sup>. Overall, aerosols reduce about 30 W m<sup>-2</sup> per day of surface net shortwave irradiance in this suburban region. Copyright 2007 by the American Geophysical Union.},

A simplified model is derived in which only overall intensities (integrated over the spectral band of insolation) are considered. Balance requirements are established which relate “top albedo” to effective absorption in the air and by the ground, both as fractions of extra-atmospheric irradiance. Measurements of diffuse radiation from the sky, in addition to global radiation, are used to specify scattering versus absorption components of aerosol attenuation for clear-sky conditions with known liquid water content and Rayleigh scattering. Data from three continental locations are selected which are representative of clear-sky attenuation over a desert (La Joya, Peru), an open prairie (O’Neill, Nebraska), and an industrialized urban area (Kew, England). The ratio of absorption to scattering shows significant systematic variation, city aerosol being more efficient as absorber, desert aerosol more as a scatterer. Effects are calculated which result from a systematic variation of ( 1 ) surface albedo, (2)liquid water content, (3) aerosol, and (4) cloud cover. Among other results i t is demonstrated how top albedo (measurable nowadays from orbiting or synchronous satellites) will react to changes in surface albedo and aerosol scattering. It is also shown numerically, how cloud effects on global radiation are modified by the existing turbidity conditions in the cloudless air.},

The dataset was compared with collocated measurements of a second spectroradiometer (Brewer MKII) and a CIMEL sun-photometer, showing correlations of 0.93 and 0.98, respectively. A seasonal variation of the AOD was observed at Thessaloniki, with AOD values at 340 nm of 0.52 and 0.28 for August and December respectively. Back trajectories of air masses for up to 4 days were used to assess the influence of long-range transport from various regions to the aerosol load over Thessaloniki. It is shown that part of the observed seasonality can be attributed to air masses with high AOD originating from North-Eastern and Eastern directions during summer-time. The analysis of the long-term record (9 years) of AOD showed a downward tendency. A similar decreasing tendency was found in the record of the PM10 aerosol measurements, which are conducted near the surface at 4 air-quality monitoring stations in the area of the city of Thessaloniki.},

The first component, NewAGE-SwRB, accounts for elevation slope, aspect, shadow of the sites, and uses suitable parameterization for obtaining the cloudless irradiance. A second component, NewAGE-DEC-MODś is implemented to estimate the irradiance reduction due to the presence of clouds according to three parameterizations. To obtain a working modeling composition that is comparable with ground data at measurement stations the two components are connected to a kriging component. With the help of an additional component, NewAGE-V (verification package), the performance of modeled (Rsw darr;) is quantitatively evaluated. The two components (and the various parameterizations they contain) are tested using the data from three basins, and some simple verification tests were carried out to assess the goodness of the methods used. Moreover, a raster mode test is performed in order to show the capability of the system in providing solar radiation raster maps. The components are part of a larger system, JGrass-NewAGE, their input and outputs are geometrical objects immediately displayed in a geographical information system (GIS). They can be used seamlessly with the various modeling solutions available in JGrass-NewAGE for the estimation of long wave radiation, evapotranspiration, and snow melting, as well as standalone components to just estimate shortwave radiation for various uses. The modularity of the approach leads to more accurate physical-statistical studies aimed to assess in depth the components ́performances and extends their results spatially, without the necessity of recoding any part of the component. textcopyright 2013 Author(s).

In order of increasing complexity the components are: direct solar irradiance at the surface, diffuse irradiance at the surface, diffuse upward flux at the surface, and diffuse upward flux at the top of the atmosphere. These components allow computation of the atmospheric absorptance. Four cases are considered from pure molecular atmospheres to atmospheres with aerosols and atmosphere with a simple uniform cloud. The molecular and aerosol cases allow comparison of aerosol forcing calculation among models. A cloud-free case with measured atmospheric and aerosol properties and measured shortwave radiation components provides an absolute basis for evaluating the models. For the aerosol-free and cloud-free dry atmospheres, models agree to within 1% (root mean square deviation as a percentage of mean) in broadband direct solar irradiance at surface; the agreement is relatively poor at 5% for a humid atmosphere. A comparison of atmospheric absorptance, computed from components of SW radiation, shows that agreement among models is understandably much worse at 3% and 10% for dry and humid atmospheres, respectively. Inclusion of aerosols generally makes the agreement among models worse than when no aerosols are present, with some exceptions. Modeled diffuse surface irradiance is higher than measurements for all models for the same model inputs. Inclusion of an optically thick low-cloud in a tropical atmosphere, a stringent test for multiple scattering calculations, produces, in general, better agreement among models for a low solar zenith angle (SZA = 30°) than for a high SZA (75°). All models show about a 30% increase in broadband absorptance for 30° SZA relative to the clear-sky case and almost no enhancement in absorptance for a higher SZA of 75°, possibly due to water vapor line saturation in the atmosphere above the cloud.

Shortwave climate forcing from direct aerosol effects is found to be much larger than indirect aerosol cloud forcing, and the total shortwave forcing, that is related to the observed 60% aerosol decline, is two to three times larger than the longwave forcing from rising anthropogenic greenhouse gases. Almost tree quarters of all the shortwave and longwave forcing energy goes into the turbulent fluxes, which increases atmospheric humidity and hence the longwave forcing by water vapour feedback. With anthropogenic aerosols now reaching low and stable values in Europe, solar forcing will subside and future temperature will mainly rise due to anthropogenic greenhouse gas warming.

There are also some indications for an "early brightening" in the first part of the 20\textsuperscript{th} century. These variations are in line with independent long-term observations of sunshine duration, diurnal temperature range, pan evaporation, and, more recently, satellite-derived estimates, which add credibility to the existence of these changes and their larger-scale significance. Current climate models, in general, tend to simulate these decadal variations to a much lesser degree. The origins of these variations are internal to the Earthś atmosphere and not externally forced by the Sun. Variations are not only found under cloudy but also under cloud-free atmospheres, indicative of an anthropogenic contribution through changes in aerosol emissions governed by economic developments and air pollution regulations. The relative importance of aerosols, clouds, and aerosol-cloud interactions may differ depending on region and pollution level. Highlighted are further potential implications of dimming and brightening for climate change, which may affect global warming, the components and intensity of the hydrological cycle, the carbon cycle, and the cryosphere among other climate elements.

  abstract         = {A fundamental determinant of climate and life on our planet is the solar radiation (sunlight) incident at the Earthś surface. Any change in this precious energy source affects our habitats profoundly. Until recently, for simplicity and lack of better knowledge, the amount of solar radiation received at the Earthś surface was assumed to be stable over the years. However, there is increasing observational evidence that this quantity undergoes significant multidecadal variations, which need to be accounted for in discussions of climate change and mitigation strategies. Coherent periods and regions with prevailing declines ("dimming") and inclines ("brightening") in surface solar radiation have been detected in the worldwide observational networks, often in accord with anthropogenic air pollution patterns. The present synthesis provides in a nutshell the main characteristics of this phenomenon, a conceptual framework for its causes, and an overview of potential environmental implications. The latest developments and remaining gaps of knowledge in this rapidly growing field of research are further highlighted. textcopyright 2012 American Meteorological Society.},

Linear trends have been calculated for the entire dataset, for cloud-free cases, and for different SZAs, separately for each season. The global upward trend in SDR after 1990 (0.33%year-1) is reconfirmed and is found to depend strongly on SZA, ranging from ∼0.1 to +0.6%year-1. The long term changes in aerosols in conjunction with the local aerosol patterns result in differences of up to 0.1%year-1 in the derived trends in SDR between morning and afternoon hours. Finally, based on the analysis of the cumulative sums of the differences in monthly averages of SDR from the long term mean we report signs of a slowdown in the upward trend in SDR during the beginning of the 2000s. textcopyright2012 Royal Meteorological Society.},

Two different periods have become evident in the analyzed time series of solar radiation: a statistically significant decrease in the annual totals of global and direct solar radiation has been detected for the period from 1955 to the beginning of the 1990s, while opposite trends have become evident during more recent years. These changes are in correlation with the changes in the amount of low clouds and in the transparency of cloudless atmosphere (atmospheric aerosol loading). Unlike solar radiation, annual mean temperature has continuously increased during 1955-2007. No time intervals with different slopes have been found in its time series. Because of the relatively short sunshine duration and low Sun elevations, the impact of solar dimming and brightening on the observed warming has turned out to be negligible in the Baltic Sea region.

  abstract         = {The aim of this study is to reveal the direct radiative effect of aerosols on global solar shortwave radiation in the region of peak Musala, which has specific climatic and environmental conditions. Correlations between the measured global solar shortwave radiation and the total aerosol content, Ångström exponent in the visible spectrum, absorption of radiation by aerosols, scattering of radiation by aerosols, Single Scattering Albedo (SSA) of aerosols are calculated using statistical methods. The results show that the underlying surface through its albedo plays a significant role in terms of the radiative effect of aerosols. At low albedo values, the higher aerosol amounts exert, at surface level, a negative radiative effect and vice versa. However, at high albedo values, the higher aerosol amounts exert, at surface level, a positive radiative effect and vice versa. This is due to the fact that a higher albedo leads to larger amounts of reflected and scattered shortwave radiation, especially close to the earthś surface, which at higher aerosol amounts result in an increase in the amount of scattered shortwave radiation, which also increases the global solar shortwave radiation. The relationships between global solar shortwave radiation and aerosols are, in most cases, non-linear, which is due to the statistical distributions of the studied parameters, which are not normal. Disclosed dependencies should be taken into account when modeling the impact of aerosols on climate change.},

The uncertainty estimates include sources that reflect realistic long-term operation conditions. The uncertainties are derived using the methodology specified by the “Guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurement.” The differences between redundant determinations of direct, diffuse, and global irradiance are analyzed and are shown to be compatible with the uncertainties. In addition, the signatures of some uncertainty sources are sought within the error statistics to find out if corrections can be applied and what their magnitude is. The global and diffuse irradiance uncertainties range from 1.8% to 2.4% without correction and are less than 1.8% with corrections. These uncertainties are close to or satisfy the BSRN targets for large signals (global: 1000 W m?2,diffuse:500 Wm?2). For small signals (50 W m?2), the targets are not achieved, mainly as a result of uncertainties associated with the data acquisition electronics (DAQ). The direct irradiance uncertainty is ∼1.5%, 3 times larger than the BSRN uncertainty target. An accuracy gain can also be achieved at the DAQ level, but even without considering the DAQ uncertainty, the target is exceeded by a factor of about 2. The direct irradiance uncertainty remains ∼1% even using an absolute cavity radiometer as transfer standard for correcting the pyrheliometer sensitivity. Thus, the direct irradiance accuracy target of 0.5% is probably not achievable with the best commercially available technology.},

In contrast, over Beijing, China, where air quality measures were taken later, solar brightening was delayed. It is shown that until the early 1990s, {UV}-A irradiances over Thessaloniki show a downward trend of –0.5\% yr−1, which reverses sign and becomes positive in the last decade (+0.8\% yr−1). This brightening is related to a decreasing trend in local aerosol amounts. Both the negative rate of change (dimming) and the positive rate of change (brightening) are ampliﬁed in the {UV}-A solar irradiances, compared with the total solar irradiance, by a factor of 2.6. Satellite derived short-wave radiation over Beijing showed negative changes of –0.4\% (1984–1991) and –0.1\% yr−1 during 1994–2006. The negative trend in solar radiation continued even during 2000–2006. Satellite-derived aerosol optical depth ({AOD}) increased by +1.0\% yr−1 during 2000–2006, in agreement with in situ measurements of increasing {AOD}. Therefore, a statistically signiﬁcant change from dimming to brightening in Beijing could not be seen in the last decade, but it is expected to occur in the near future.},
